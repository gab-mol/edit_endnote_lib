Acanthoscurria gomesiana is a Brazilian spider from the Theraphosidae family inhabiting regions of Southeastern Brazil. Potent antimicrobial peptides as gomesin and acanthoscurrin have been discovered from the spider hemolymph in previous works. Spider venoms are also recognized as sources of biologically active peptides, however the venom peptidome of A. gomesiana remained unexplored to date. In this work, a MS-based workflow was applied to the investigation of the spider venom peptidome. Data-independent and data-dependent LC-MS/MS acquisitions of intact peptides and of peptides submitted to multiple enzyme digestions, followed by automated chromatographic alignment, de novo analysis, database and homology searches with manual validations showed that the venom is composed by &lt;165 features, with masses ranging from 0.4-15.8kDa. From digestions, 135 peptides were identified from 17 proteins, including three new mature peptides: U1-TRTX-Agm1a, U1-TRTX-Agm2a and U1-TRTX-Agm3a, containing 3, 4 and 3 disulfide bonds, respectively. The toxins U1-TRTX-Agm1a differed by only one amino acid from U1-TRTX-Ap1a from A. paulensis and U1-TRTX-Agm2a was derived from the genicutoxin-D1 precursor from A. geniculata. These toxins have potential applications as antimicrobial agents, as the peptide fraction of A. gomesiana showed activity against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Candida albicans strains. MS data are available via ProteomeXchange Consortium with identifier PXD003884. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Biological fluids of the Acanthoscurria gomesiana spider are sources of active molecules, as is the case of antimicrobial peptides and acylpolyamines found in the hemolymphs. The venom is also a potential source of toxins with pharmacological and biotechnological applications. However, to our knowledge no A. gomesiana venom toxin structure has been determined to date. Using a combination of high resolution mass spectrometry, transcriptomics and bioinformatics, we employed a workflow to fully sequence, determine the number of disulfide bonds of mature peptides and we found new potential antimicrobial peptides. This workflow is suitable for complete peptide toxin sequencing when handling limited amount of venom samples and can accelerate the discovery of peptides with potential biotechnological applications.<p>

In this study we present a quick and easy method for counting trinucleotide repeats by de-oxyadenosine overhang (A-overhang)-dependent repeat expansion determination (ADRED). During standard Taq DNA polymerase-based sequencing reactions, the unterminated sequencing products of short PCR fragments are tagged with a 3'-end A-overhang that is visible as an intense peak in an electropherogram; this allows for easy and precise determination of the fragment length and thus the extent of repeat expansions. ADRED has clear advantages over existing methods, because repeat numbers of both normal and pathogenic (expanded) alleles can be analyzed without using labeled primers or labeled DNA standards. Because ADRED includes a sequencing step, disease-relevant polymorphisms (e.g., CAA interruptions in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2) can simultaneously be detected.<p>

17-Alkoxycarbonyl- and 17-carboxamido-3beta-hydroxy-13alpha-androsta-5,16-diene derivatives were synthetized in high yields in the palladium-catalyzed carbonylation reactions of the corresponding 3beta-hydroxy-17-iodo-13alpha-androsta-5,16-diene. This substrate with a 17-iodo-16-ene functionality was obtained from the 17-keto derivative via its 17-hydrazone, which was treated with iodine in the presence of a base (1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine). 17-Carboxamides were obtained by chemoselective aminocarbonylation through the use of amines, including amino acid esters, as N-nucleophiles. The 17-methoxycarbonyl-16-ene derivative was synthetized by using methanol as O-nucleophile. The parent compound of this series, the 17-carboxylic acid derivative, was formed in the presence of water via hydroxycarbonylation.<p>

The functional conversion of hemocyanin (Hc), an oxygen transporter, into an enzyme was investigated in crustaceans. Hc is converted into a phenoloxidase-like enzyme by hemocyte components, which is triggered by beta-1,3-glucan. This activation is severely hampered with leupeptin and E-64 treatment, indicating that the serine/cysteine proteases in the hemocytes are involved in the activation. In a SDS-PAGE-analysis, no change was observed between normal and activated Hc under reduced conditions. However, under non-reduced condition of normal Hc, several minor bands were observed at oligomeric position of Hc subunit, which disappeared upon activation. These results indicate that a split of the reductive bond, such as the disulfide bond between subunits, is essential for Hc activation. This is the first report to show the enzymatic conversion of Hc and the presence of the covalent bond in the Hc subunit of crustaceans.<p>

BACKGROUND: The family of aquaporin water channels contributes to water and salt homeostasis. AQP5 is a ubiquitously expressed exocrine-type water channel. Functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in AQP5 which alter gene transcription have not yet been described. We, therefore, sequenced the human AQP5 promoter to detect novel sequence variants which could impact upon AQP5 expression and contribute to the phenotypic variability of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). METHOD AND RESULTS: Sequencing of the whole AQP5 promoter revealed a novel-1364A/C polymorphism. Substitution of C for A was associated with increased transcription factor binding as tested by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, but significantly reduced transcriptional activation of the AQP5 gene by cAMP and serum. The C allele was associated with significantly decreased mRNA in human heart and with decreased protein expression in erythrocyte membranes. Finally, we associated AQP5 genotypes with the variability of the RAAS in two independent study cohorts. First, we studied the phenotypic variability of the RAAS in 103 young (26 +/- 3 years) healthy males under an increased dietary salt intake. Increasing salt intake decreased plasma angiotensin II by 25% in AC/CC genotypes but only by 2% in AA genotypes (P = 0.012), and it decreased serum aldosterone by 34% in subjects with AC/CC genotypes but only by 19% in the AA genotypes (P = 0.005). Both genotypes had increased blood pressure under salt diet (P &lt; 0.01), which was significantly more pronounced in AA genotypes (P = 0.029). Second, we investigated associations with variables of the RAAS in 96 old patients (68 +/- 10 years) with coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting. Aldosterone serum concentrations were 2-fold (P &lt; 0.001) and angiotensin II plasma concentrations were 4-fold higher in AA genotypes than in AC/CC genotypes while ADH plasma concentrations did not differ. CONCLUSION: A novel single nucleotide polymorphism in the AQP5 gene promoter alters AQP5 expression in different in vitro systems and cells, and is associated with alterations of variables of the RAAS both in young healthy males and in patients with coronary artery disease.<p>

INTRODUCTION: For the prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) after coronary angiography, hydration by 0.9% sodium chloride solution and N-acetylcysteine is currently recommended. However, it is unclear whether volume supplementation with sodium bicarbonate is better than with sodium chloride when used in conjunction with nonionic, low-osmolar iopamidol. The aim of this study was to analyze and compare the effects of sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride on renal function in 145 patients exposed to nonionic iso-osmolar contrast medium iodixanol in a randomized study. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Renal Insufficiency Following Radiocontrast Exposure is a prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded trial of 145 patients (age 72.6+/-6.7 years) with elevated baseline serum creatinine levels (mean 132.6+/-29.3 micromol/l). Eligible patients were randomized to either a 154 mEq/l infusion of sodium bicarbonate (n=71, group I) or sodium chloride 0.9% solution (n=74, group II). The primary endpoint was serum creatinine elevation beyond 25% or 44 micromol/l on the first or second day following exposure to the contrast medium. Serum creatinine, serum cystatin C, plasma viscosity, urinary enzymes alanine aminopeptidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, and alpha1-microglobulin were measured at baseline and on days 1 and 2 after contrast medium administration. RESULTS: An overall proportion of five CIN (3.4%) was observed with equal distribution among the groups (4.2% in sodium bicarbonate group vs. 2.7% in sodium chloride group; P=0.614). Parameters of renal function demonstrated no differences between the two hydration regimens on day 1 after angiography; even on day 2 most parameters were similar in groups I and II. CONCLUSION: Renal Insufficiency Following Radiocontrast Exposure demonstrates a homogeneously low rate of CIN after exposure to nonionic, iso-osmolar iodixanol regardless of the use of either bicarbonate sodium or sodium chloride solution for volume supplementation. Low-toxicity contrast media and any hydration may offset potential antioxidant effects of sodium bicarbonate.<p>

Agarwal, A., et al. (2008). &quot;Image quality evaluation with a new phase rotation beamformer.&quot; <u>IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control</u> <b>55</b>(9): 1947-1955.<p>
Over the last few decades, dynamic focusing based on digital receive beamforming (DRBF) has led to significant improvements in image quality. However, it is computationally very demanding due to its requirement for multiple lowpass filters (e.g., a complex filter for each receive channel in quadrature demodulation-based phase rotation beamformers (QD-PRBF)). We recently developed a novel phase rotation beamformer with reduced complexity, which can lower: 1) the number of lowpass filters using 2-stage demodulation (TSD) and 2) the number of beamforming points using adap tive field-of-view (AFOV) imaging. In TSD, dynamic focusing is performed on the mixed signals, while sampling frequency of the beamformed signal (i.e., beamforming frequency) is adjusted based on the displayed field-of-view (FOV) size in AFOV imaging. In this paper, the image quality of the developed beamformer (i.e., TSD-AFOV-PRBF) has been quantitatively evaluated using phantom and in vivo data. From the phantom study, it was found that TSD-AFOV-PRBF with only 1024 beamforming points provides comparable image quality to QD-PRBF. We obtained a median contrast resolution (CR) degradation of 7.6% for the FOV size of 160 mm. Image quality steadily improves with FOV size reduction (e.g., 2.3% CR degradation at 85 mm). Similar results were also obtained from an in vivo study. Thus, TSD-AFOV-PRBF could provide comparable image quality to conventional beamformers at considerably reduced computational cost.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) has been associated with TP53 germline mutations and Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). We describe our finding of a novel germline mutation in the TP53 gene in a family with multiple malignancies and in association with a child presenting with CPC. METHOD: An 8-month-old male presented with seizure-like activity; imaging disclosed a 1.5-cm left ventricular mass confirmed to be CPC intra- and postoperatively. Family history was significant for a half-sister who died of a primary CNS sarcoma and a paternal grandmother negative for BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, and MSH2 mutations with multiple (&gt;6) LFS spectrum malignancies. RESULTS: Familial TP53 testing revealed an A--&gt;T substitution at DNA position 13071, creating a deleterious Asn--&gt;Ile substitution at amino acid 131 in exon 5. CONCLUSION: Physicians treating patients with CPC should be attuned to reviewing family history for risk factors suggestive of genetic cancer syndromes such as LFS. These syndromes markedly influence both the patient and family members and may alter postoperative treatment regimens.<p>

A new crystal structure of the dimeric cysteine synthase CysM from Mycobacterium tuberculosis reveals an open and a closed conformation of the enzyme. In the closed conformation the five carboxy-terminal amino acid residues are inserted into the active site cleft. Removal of this segment results in a decreased lifetime of the alpha-aminoacrylate reaction intermediate, an increased sensitivity to oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide, and loss of substrate selectivity with respect to the sulfur carrier thiocarboxylated CysO. These results highlight features of CysM that might be of particular importance for cysteine biosynthesis under oxidative stress in M. tuberculosis.<p>

Unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) have profound effects on the fluidity and function of biological membranes. Microorganisms, plants and animals regulate the synthesis of UFAs during changing environmental conditions as well as in response to nutrients. UFAs homeostasis in many organisms is achieved by feedback regulation of fatty acid desaturase gene transcription through signalling pathways that are governed by sensors embedded in cellular membranes. Here, we review recently discovered components of the regulatory machinery governing the transcription of fatty acid desaturases in bacteria, yeasts and animals that indicate an ancient role of transmembrane signalling mechanisms and integrate membrane composition with lipid biosynthesis.<p>

In this work, we have explored the biochemical changes characterizing the transition from vitellogenesis to follicular atresia, employing the hematophagous insect vector Dipetalogaster maxima as a model. Standardized insect rearing conditions were established to induce a gradual follicular degeneration stage by depriving females of blood meal during post-vitellogenesis. For the studies, hemolymph and ovaries were sampled at representative days of pre-vitellogenesis, vitellogenesis and early and late follicular atresia. When examined by scanning electron microscopy, ovarioles at the initial stage of atresia were small but still showed some degree of asynchronism, a feature that was lost in an advanced degeneration state. At late follicular atresia, in vivo uptake assays of fluorescently labeled vitellogenin (Vg-FITC) showed loss of competitiveness of oocytes to uptake vitellogenin. Circulating vitellogenin levels in atresia were significantly higher than those registered at pre-vitellogenesis, most likely to maintain appropriate conditions for another gonotrophic cycle if a second blood meal is available. Follicular atresia was also characterized by partial proteolysis of vitellin, which was evidenced in ovarian homogenates by western blot. When the activity of ovarian peptidases upon hemoglobin (a non-specific substrate) was tested, higher activities were detected at early and late atresia whereas the lowest activity was found at vitellogenesis. The activity upon hemoglobin was significantly inhibited by pepstatin A (an aspartic peptidase inhibitor), and was not affected by E64 (a cysteine peptidase inhibitor) at any tested conditions. The use of specific fluorogenic substrates demonstrated that ovarian homogenates at early follicular atresia displayed high cathepsin D-like activity, whereas no activity of either, cathepsin B or L was detected. Mass spectrometry analysis of the digestion products of the substrate Abz-AIAFFSRQ-EDDnp further confirmed the presence of a cathepsin D-like peptidase in ovarian tissue. In the context of our findings, the early activation of cathepsin D-like peptidase could be relevant in promoting yolk protein recycling and/or enhancing follicle removal.<p>

Cardiac allograft rejection is currently diagnosed from endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) that are invasive and impractical to repeat. A serological marker could facilitate rejection monitoring and minimize EMB-associated risks. We investigated the relation of serum matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A concentrations to cardiac allograft rejection, using 1176 EMBs and serum samples obtained from 208 recipients. Acute cellular rejection was diagnosed in 186 EMBs. Mean week 1 and week 2 serum MMP-1 concentrations predicted rejection (p = 0.001, AUC = 0.80). At the optimal cut-off level of &gt;or=7.5 ng/mL, MMP-1 predicted rejection with 82% sensitivity and 72% specificity. Initial serum MMP-1 &lt;5.3 ng/mL (lowest quartile) was associated with rejection-free outcome in 80% of patients. Both MMP-1 (p &lt; 0.001, AUC = 0.67-0.75) and VEGF-A (p &lt; 0.01, AUC = 0.62-0.67) predicted rejection on the next EMB, while rejection at EMB was identified only by VEGF-A (p &lt; 0.02, AUC = 0.70-0.77). Patients receiving combined cyclosporine-A and everolimus had the lowest serum MMP-1 concentrations. While serum MMP-1 predicts rejection-free outcome and VEGF-A identifies rejection on EMB, both markers predict rejection in follow-up of cardiac transplant recipients. Combination of serum MMP-1 and VEGF-A concentration may be a noninvasive prognostic marker of cardiac allograft rejection, and could have important implications for choice of surveillance and immunosuppression protocols.<p>

CONTEXT: Blood levels of homocysteine may be increased in Alzheimer disease (AD) and hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to disease pathophysiology by vascular and direct neurotoxic mechanisms. Even in the absence of vitamin deficiency, homocysteine levels can be reduced by administration of high-dose supplements of folic acid and vitamins B(6) and B(12). Prior studies of B vitamins to reduce homocysteine in AD have not had sufficient size or duration to assess their effect on cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of B vitamin supplementation in the treatment of AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of high-dose folate, vitamin B(6), and vitamin B(12) supplementation in 409 (of 601 screened) individuals with mild to moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 14 and 26, inclusive) and normal folic acid, vitamin B(12), and homocysteine levels. The study was conducted between February 20, 2003, and December 15, 2006, at clinical research sites of the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study located throughout the United States. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups of unequal size to increase enrollment (60% treated with high-dose supplements [5 mg/d of folate, 25 mg/d of vitamin B(6), 1 mg/d of vitamin B(12)] and 40% treated with identical placebo); duration of treatment was 18 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Change in the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). RESULTS: A total of 340 participants (202 in active treatment group and 138 in placebo group) completed the trial while taking study medication. Although the vitamin supplement regimen was effective in reducing homocysteine levels (mean [SD], -2.42 [3.35] in active treatment group vs -0.86 [2.59] in placebo group; P &lt; .001), it had no beneficial effect on the primary cognitive measure, rate of change in ADAS-cog score during 18 months (0.372 points per month for placebo group vs 0.401 points per month for active treatment group, P = .52; 95% confidence interval of rate difference, -0.06 to 0.12; based on the intention-to-treat generalized estimating equations model), or on any secondary measures. A higher quantity of adverse events involving depression was observed in the group treated with vitamin supplements. CONCLUSION: This regimen of high-dose B vitamin supplements does not slow cognitive decline in individuals with mild to moderate AD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00056225.<p>

Hypogonadism, alopecia, diabetes mellitus, mental retardation, and extrapyramidal syndrome (also referenced as Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome) is a rare autosomal recessive multisystemic disorder. We have identified a founder mutation consisting of a single base-pair deletion in C2orf37 in eight families of Saudi origin. Three other loss-of-function mutations were subsequently discovered in patients of different ethnicities. The gene encodes a nucleolar protein of unknown function, and the cellular phenotype observed in patient lymphoblasts implicates a role for the nucleolus in the pathogenesis of this disease. Our findings expand the list of human disorders linked to the nucleolus and further highlight the developmental and/or maintenance functions of this organelle.<p>

Lipid content and class in the Northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica (digestive gland, stomach, gonad, fat body, abdomen) was investigated and correlated with sex and reproductive stage. Ready to spawn females, have high lipid content in ovaries, while in males and spent females, the major site of lipid deposits was the digestive gland, followed by the fat body. These differences among spawning and spent females are indicative of strong interactions between the ovary and digestive gland and the ovary and fat body during vitellogenesis. Triacylglycerols (TAG) were the major neutral lipid class with high levels in the digestive gland. The major phospholipid was phosphatidylcholine (PC) particularly in the muscular tissue of the abdomen. Phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (PE) and -serine-inositol (PS-PI), were present at intermediate levels. Reproductive males were depleted in TAG and diacylglycerols (DAG) in the digestive gland, gonad and fat body, and had 4 times lower cholesterol in the gonad than ready to spawn females. Furthermore, ready to spawn females had in the ovary higher amounts of TAG, DAG and phospholipids (PC, PE, PS-PI) than spent females. Linear relationships between lipid content and main lipid class (TAG, PC, PE, PS-PI) in different fractions of males and ready to spawn females showed that: (1). TAG was stored for both sexes in all cephalothorax fractions with highest values in the digestive gland and ovary fluid; (2). PC was accumulated for both sexes in the fat body and the gonad with a higher slope for females, with the highest values in the ovary fluid and in the abdomen of males and that (3). PS-PI was stored only in the ovary and abdomen of mature females. These results are discussed in terms of the strategy developed by Meganyctiphanes norvegica to allocate lipids to the next generation for optimised embryogenesis.<p>

Mucin glycoproteins are a major constituent of salivary secretions and play a primary role in the protection of the oral cavity. Rat submandibular glands (RSMG) synthesize and secrete a low molecular weight (114 kDa) mucin glycoprotein. We have isolated, partially sequenced, and characterized the gene which encodes the RSMG apomucin. The gene is encoded by three exons of 106 nt, 69 nt, and 991 nt, separated by introns of 921 nt and 12.5 kb. CAAT and TATA elements are present, at -68 and -26, respectively, in the 5' flanking sequence of the RSMG apomucin gene. The tandem repeat domain present in exon III consists of ten tandem repeats of 39 nt encoding the consensus sequence PTTDSTTPAPTTK. Sequence comparison and organization of the nucleic acid sequence encoding the tandem repeats of two alleles for this gene suggests that the apomucin gene has undergone recombinational events during its evolution. No significant sequence similarity was found with other mucin genes, or with other known salivary gland-specific genes. The gene was localized to rat chromosome 14 using somatic cell hybrids that segregate rat chromosomes. Since this, to our knowledge, represents the first RSMG mucin gene cloned, we have designated this gene Mucsmg.<p>

The influence of thioalkyl acid ligand was evaluated during aqueous synthesis at 100 degrees C and under hydrothermal conditions (150 degrees C) of CdTe and CdSe quantum dots (QDs). Experiments performed with 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) and 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) demonstrated that the use of MHA and MUA allowed for the preparation of very small nanoparticles (0.6-2.5 nm) in carrying out the reaction under atmospheric pressure or in an autoclave and that the photophysical properties of QDs were dependent on the ligand and on the synthesis conditions. The influence of various experimental conditions, including the Te-to-Cd ratio, temperature, and precursor concentration, on the growth rate of CdTe or CdSe QDs has been systematically investigated. The fluorescence intensities of CdTe QDs capped with MPA, MHA, or MUA versus pH were also found to be related to the surface coverage of the nanoparticles.<p>

Achondroplasia, an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, is one of the most common forms of skeletal dysplasia resulting in disproportionate extreme shortness. Recently, two point mutations, both affecting nucleotide 1138 in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3) gene, were found to be the cause of the disorder. We investigated DNA from 16 Swedish patients with achondroplasia for the presence of these mutations. All patients were found to be heterozygous for the G to A transition at nucleotide 1138. Our data thus support previous reports showing a striking genetic homogeneity, in that almost all achondroplasia patients have the FGFR3 G380R mutation at the protein level.<p>

Drusen are extra-cellular deposits that form between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane (BM). Numerous and/or confluent drusen are a significant risk factor for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Here, using whole mounted human RPE preparation we show that RPE cell morphology changes in association with drusen. These changes included an increase in cell size and distortion in the regularity of their distribution. Further, although binucleation is relatively rare in human RPE, there was a marked increase in the number of binucleated RPE cell associated with individual druse. Surprisingly many of these changes were found at distances up to 400 microm from drusen.<p>

Blue oxygen binding protein hemocyanin from scorpion Buthus sindicus has been investigated using low resolution techniques. The native protein is a polymer of eight different types of subunits arranged in four cubic hexameric form (4x6-mers) as previously annotated using a combination of various types of chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques. In addition, both &quot;top face&quot; as well as the &quot;side view&quot; of the native assembly has also been identified from the negatively stained specimens using transmission electron microscopy confirming the overall structural features of arthropodan hemocyanins. These results are also supported from data obtained from another low resolution technique i.e. Small Angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). SAXS results under oxygenated and deoxygenated states represent a validation case for this technique with key conformational changes of Rg 88.0 --&gt; 86.0 A; +/- 1% (Dmax 280.0 --&gt; 290.0 A; +/- 2%), respectively suggesting that the oxygenated hemocyanin is longer then the deoxygenated hemocyanin by almost 2 A;. Likewise, active conformations of the purified structural and functional subunit Bsin1 under oxygenated and deoxygenated states also determined by SAXS measurements revealed a Rg value of 25.2 --&gt; 25.7 A; +/- 1% (Dmax 75.0 --&gt; 75.5 A; +/- 2%), respectively suggesting very little or no contribution of the individual subunit in the overall conformational change in the native assembly during molecular breathing. Preliminary molecular shapes for the oxy-molecules, calculated directly from the scattering profile-alone in a model-independent procedure, superimpose well on other closely related known three-dimensional structures of the same size. Structural and functional aspects of the native as well as purified subunit and the application of these low resolution techniques like transmission electron microscopy and Small Angle X-ray scattering have been discussed.<p>

A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.<p>

The aims of the present study were to compare nocturnal growth hormone (GH) secretion, insulin requirements and insulin sensitivity on two occasions in six adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes when the GH secretion was reduced one night by an oral dose of 100 mg of pirenzepine at bedtime. The mean nocturnal intravenous insulin infusion required to maintain a normal constant blood glucose concentration between 24:00 and 07:00 was 53% higher during the night on placebo (p = 0.0212). During the night on pirenzepine, the serum GH area under the curve (AUC) was reduced in all patients to a mean concentration which was 50.1% (15-78%) of that during the night without pirenzepine (p = 0.0036). The nocturnal urinary GH excretion was also reduced in all of the investigated patients (p = 0.0229). Insulin sensitivity in the morning, measured by the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamp, increased significantly from 115 +/- 51 mg m-2 min-1 after the night on placebo to 205 +/- 67 mg m-2 min-1 after the night on pirenzepine (p = 0.0161). No side-effects were observed during the pirenzepine night. Negative correlations were found between the nocturnal serum GH AUC and the insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (r = -0.65, p = 0.0241) and between the nocturnal urinary GH excretion and the insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism (r = -0.77, p = 0.0054). In conclusion, the present study shows a relation between GH secretion and insulin resistance in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes. The administration of pirenzepine acutely reduces GH secretion and improves insulin sensitivity.<p>

BACKGROUND: Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the end-stage of peripheral artery disease. Only about two thirds of patients with CLI can be revascularised, one third progresses to leg amputation with high associated morbidity and mortality. Therapeutic angiogenesis with bone marrow cells has shown promising improvement in less severe stages of peripheral ischemia. Our study evaluates the therapeutic value of bone marrow cell induced angiogenesis and arteriogenesis in severe, limb-threatening ischemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: the BONe Marrow Outcome Trial in Critical Limb Ischemia (BONMOT-CLI) is a investigator-initiated, double-blinded, 1:1 randomized, placebo-controlled multi-centre study at 4 sites in Germany. Only patients with no option for revascularisation or after failed revascularisation will be included. A total of 90 patients is to be included. One arm with 45 subjects will be treated with a concentrate of autologous bone marrow cells which will be injected at 40 sites into the ischemic limb. In the placebo arm, study subjects will undergo a sham bone marrow punction and 40 saline injections. At three months, a combined primary endpoint of major amputation or persisting critical limb ischemia (no clinical or perfusion improvement) will be evaluated. Secondary endpoints are death, changes in perfusion, quality of life, walking distance, minor amputations, wound healing, collateral density and cancer incidence. Post-study follow-up is up to two years. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this first randomized placebo-controlled trial for autologous bone marrow cell therapy in CLI will clarify the value of this new therapeutic modality in a patient population with no other alternatives except major amputation.<p>

Because of bradyarrhythmic complications under anesthesia in two Airedale Terriers, we performed a prospective search of ECG-abnormalities in healthy dogs of that breed. Resting ECG's were screened for routine abnormalities. None of the 42 dogs investigated so far had a completely normal ECG. Among the common abnormalities were: deviation of the mean electrical axis (MEA) in 32 dogs, low voltage QRS-complexes in 22 dogs, and AV-blocks 1st degree in 14 dogs. None of the recorded abnormalities with the exception of AV-blocks, were considered predictors of anesthetic complications. Because of the high frequency of recorded abnormalities, we are continuing this prospective study.<p>

Laparoscopy is being used to assist in an increasing number and variety of bowel procedures. However, when being used for neoplastic disease concerns of margins and adequacy of mesenteric dissection must be addressed. We've performed 110 laparoscopic-assisted bowel procedures, with 45 of these performed for neoplastic disease. Ninety-two bowel resections were performed including 24 subtotal, total, or proctocolectomies. In this chapter we review the results of our series, as well as other reported series, and discuss some of the controversies involved with laparoscopy for neoplastic disease.<p>

Serum levels of prolactin, progesterone, estradiol-17-beta, FSH and LH were determined during both cycles. Endometrial biopsies were taken from most patients during the late luteal phase. Two patients had persistent hyperprolactinemia, approximately 35-45 ng/ml, and both had repeated insufficient luteal function, which completely reverted to normal during treatment. Five of the 10 normoprolactinemic patients achieved a normal luteal function during bromocriptine therapy.

The purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of two strategies for using undergraduate paraprofessionals as tutors for first-grade children with reading difficulties. The two groups of undergraduates taught first graders the same 150 words, and both reinforced (socially and materially) correct performances. However, one group employed a programmed method of word presentation (i.e., the Edmark Reading Program), while the other group of tutors was allowed flexibility in the pacing and methods for presenting words. The performance of each reading group was compared to that of a control group who engaged in educational activities not directly related to reading. Thirty-six poor readers were randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Subjects were tutored after school by university undergraduates for an average of twenty-three 40-minute sessions. Children in both reading groups showed significantly more improvement than controls on an oral reading posttest of the 150 criterion words. Treatment effects did not emerge on a test composed mainly of noncriterion words.<p>

A study has been made of the ultrastructure of four strains of Neisseria meningitidis which liberate varying amounts of free endotoxin in a chemically-defined, protein-free medium. The two strains which did not release detectable or only sparse amounts of free, filtrable endotoxin were rather uniform in cell size. Their cells appeared to be intact and showed a low tendency to aggregate, In addition cells of these strains showed only sporadic loose, trilaminar membranes and blebs, and free membranous structures were sparse in the medium. The endotoxin releasing strains liberated a high yield of free structures from the outer cell wall into the medium. These structures may represent the lipopolysaccharide (LPS).<p>

A simple chemical system consisting of FeSO4 and H2O2 (Fenton's reagent) was shown to emit light (chemiluminescence). The addition of tryptophan to the reaction markedly enhanced light production. Very little chemiluminescence was observed when H2O2 was omitted from the reaction and when ferric, instead of ferrous, ions were used. Hydroxyl radical (OH.) and singlet oxygen (1 deltagO2) quenchers suppressed chemiluminescence of the FeSO4 + tryptophan + H2O2 system; and, deuterium oxide (2H2O) enhanced chemiluminescence of both FeSO4 reactions. These observations suggest that a radical chain reaction involving both OH. and 1 deltag O2 is responsible for the chemiluminescent reactions. Six iron-containing proteins, some of which are located within granulocytes, all emitted light in the presence of H2O2. Since iron and H2O2 are present in metabolically stimulated granulocytes, it is likely that chemiluminescent reactions similar to the ones demonstrated in this study account for part of the chemiluminescence of activated granulocytes.<p>

Serum lipids and the kinetics of the two primary bile acids, cholic acid (C) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CD), were studied in six normolipidaemic subjects before and during treatment with cholestyramine (12 g/day). After therapy, total serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by about 15%. These changes were accompanied by significant increases in the pool size, synthesis, and fractional turnover rate (FTR) of C and in the synthesis and FTR of CD. In spite of the enhanced formation of CD, the CD pool size decreased in all subjects, on average by more than 50%. The combined pool size of C and CD remained constant, but the mean total bile acid formation increased by a factor of 2.9. It is suggested that the different responses of C and CD, with an augmented contribution of C to the total amounts of bile acid produced, reflect an enhanced hepatic cholesterogenesis and, possibly, that C and CD to some extent originate from different cholesterol precursor pools.<p>

Six normolipidemic and six hypertriglyceridemic subjects were studied. The investigations were conducted before and after the basal diet (cholesterol intake about 0.8 mmol/day) was replaced by a cholesterol-rich diet (cholesterol intake about 4 mmol/day). Irrespective of the type of diet, the combined formation of cholic acid (C) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CD) was about two times higher in the hyperlipoproteinemic (mostly type IV) than the normolipidemic subjects. With the cholesterol-rich diet, the total plasma cholesterol increased in all normolipidemic and in four hyperlipidemic patients. Although total bile acid formation remained constant, there were several indications that an augmented intake of dietary cholesterol influenced bile acid metabolism. The pool size of CD increased in all but one normolipidemic subject. This group also displayed a decrease in the C/CD ratio of the bile acids produced and in the C/CD ratio of the bile acids in duodenal bile. The latter finding was also encountered in the hyperlipoproteinemic patients. On the basis of these and other data, it is suggested that the pattern of the bile acids synthesized may roughly reflect the degree of hepatic cholesterogenesis. Cholesterol feeding had no consistent effects on the molar cholesterol concentration in duodenal bile.-Andersen, E., and K. Hellstrom.

Out of 10 440 children, 266 with low (less than 2.5 centile) values for very low-low density lipoproteins in cord serum were chosen to be followed up to find out how many came from families with familial hypobetalipoproteinaemia (FHBL).

Early infant feeding habits, current dietary intake and serum lipids were investigated in 31 infants, age 6--10 months and 64 children, age 3--4 years. In the infants there was a correlation between serum lipid levels and the amount of saturated fat and the P/S ratio of the diet. No such correlation was found in the 3--4 year old children. Neither was there any correlation between the type and duration of early infant feeding and subsequent serum lipid levels. In both the infants and the 3--4 year old children serum cholesterol concentration correlated with the serum cholesterol concentration in each of the parents.<p>

As part of a screening study for the detection of hyperlipoproteinemia in 10,000 newborns, cord serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured in detail in 1025 infants. Elevated cord serum VLDL-LDL-cholesterol could easily be identified by a rapid turbidimetric estimation of cord serum VLDL-LDL. Cord serum VLDL-LDL-cholesterol was found to be significantly higher than normal in premature, asphyxiated and beta-methasone-phenobarbital-ritodrine treated infants. Other obstetric complications, however, were not associated with hyperlipoproteinemia. Furthermore all 2050 parents had their serum cholesterol determined. 3 parents had familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). One child also had FH, though her cord serum total cholesterol and VLDL-LDL-cholesterol were normal. The 2 other children of the 3 FH parents, had normal lipids and lipoproteins both at birth and follow-up.<p>

Among 10 440 newborns, 522 with upper 5 percentile values for very low-low density lipoprotein cholesterol in cord serum were selected for follow-up studies.

In 273 of the 522 children, serum lipids were determined between the ages of 1 and 2 years and were now found to be normal, except in the 11 children with FH. Furthermore the serum lipids were compared in subgroups of these 273 children divided according to obstetric complications (i.e. low birth-weight, perinatal asphyxia and antepartum betamethasone treatment), which may cause a rise in serum lipids at birth. No differences were found between these subgroups at the age of 1--2 years.<p>

A three-generation transmission of under five percentile values for serum low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterol typical of heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia was demonstrated in a Danish family. Slight clinical signs of CNS abnormality were found in 4 of the 8 subjects with heterozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia, but did not resemble the neurological findings in abetalipoproteinemia nor in the previously described patients with familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. There were no signs of myelin dysfunction in the central nervous system as judged from the normal latency of visual and somatosensory evoked potentials.<p>

Medium which has been dialyzed against a dense population of Tetrahymena cells contains a factor which reduces the rate of RNA synthesis in other Tetrahymena cells inoculated on that medium.

Andersen, H. A. and S. J. Nielsen (1979). &quot;Regulation of RNA synthesis in Tetrahymena pyriformis: secretion of regulatory factors.&quot; <u>Journal of Cell Science</u> <b>35</b>: 17-24.<p>
The rate of ribosomal RNA synthesis varies greatly with the population density in both exponentially and synchronously growing populations of Tetrahymena pyriformis. Shortly after inoculation of the population - at relatively low cell densities - a gene-dose effect dominates the picture, and a doubling in the gene number is immediately followed by a doubling in the rate of RNA synthesis. However, also other mechanisms are controlling the rate of RNA synthesis. Generally one finds high rates of RNA synthesis in the lag phase of newly inoculated cells, decreasing rate of RNA synthesis during most of the exponential growth phase and very low rate of synthesis in stationary phase cells. We now have results which show that the repression of RNA synthesis in densely populated cultures is caused by a dialysable factor, which is secreted by the cells. If cells are inoculated on a medium which contains this factor the high initial rate of RNA synthesis normally observed is prevented, but the cells multiply and grow with normal generation time until normal stationary-phase population densities are reached.<p>

Screening of 3060 neonates for congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection by virus excretion in the urine showed an overall incidence of 0.4%. The incidence was about 1% for mothers between 16 and 25 years and only 0.2% for mothers between 25 and 35. No mothers over 35 years of age gave birth to congenitally infected infants. The percentage of women in the child-bearing age susceptible to CMV infection was estimated by the absence of CMV complement-fixing antibodies in cord sera and ranged from 48% to 33% with increasing age. None of the infected infants showed obvious signs of congenital CMV infection at birth. At follow-up, two infants showed slight, but transient symptoms compatible with a foetal infection; a pair of premature twins exhibited retarded physical and psychomotor development, but this could just as well be ascribed to the prematurity itself. None of the infants had detectable CMV--IgM antibodies in cord sera, but a trend towards elevated total IgM concentration in cord sera and elevated virus excretion titres appeared in the infants with symptoms. With the very low incidence and no signs of sensomotor sequelae the preliminary conclusion is that foetal CMV infection in our population by no means has a significance to deserve screening or a vaccination programme.<p>

A system is described which considerably facilitates the reading and the subsequent conversion of measured values to protein concentrations, when proteins are quantitated by the electroimmunoassay a.m. Laurell (1972). The rocket heights of calibration samples and unknown samples are read by a cursor on a magnetic table (Digitizer, Hewlett Packard) and the values are automatically transferred to a programmable calculator (HP 9830 A, Hewlett Packard). It is programmed to calculate the protein concentration of samples by interpolation on a calibration curve fitted to the best polynomium of second degree by the method of least squares. The results and sequence numbers are automatically printed out from a printer (HP 9866 A, Hewlett, Packard), Reading and calculation of the results from one plate with 5 calibration samples (in duplicate) and 20 unknown samples are completed in less than 2 min. This is 10--15 times faster compared with a manual procedure where a hand-drawn calibration curve is used for interpolation.<p>

We studied nasal mucous flow, airway resistance, and subjective response in 16 young healthy subjects during 5-hour exposures to 2, 10, and 25 mg of inert dust per m3 in an environmental chamber. The dust was a fully polymerized plastic dust containing carbon black. The number of these particles in room air, expressed as a per cent of the total number of particles was 36, 41, 14, 7, and 2, respectively, for the aerodynamic size ranges less than or equal to 1.8, 1.9 to 5.3, 5.4 to 8.9, 9.0 to 12.4, and greater than or equal to 12.5 micron. No significant changes in nasal mucociliary clearance rate or nasal resistance were observed. At all dust concentrations there was a decrease in 1-sec forced expiratory volume, but not in the forced vital capacity or the forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity. The nasal penetration fraction of particles was approximately 55 per cent for the smallest particles and 20 per cent for the largest particles. Discomfort was proportional to the concentration of dust, but lagged almost 2 hours behind the changes in dust concentration. The discomfort was never excessive; the main complaints were dryness in the nose and pharynx.<p>

In 40 breasts with primary carcinoma, the nipple and areola were cut horizontally in order to investigate the frequency of intraductal and invasive cancer. In 20 of these breasts the nipple and/or areola were found to be involved at a depth of 1 cm (50%; 95% confidence limits: 33.8-66.2%). Eleven neoplasms were purely intraductal, eight intraductal as well as stromal, and only one purely stromal. By means of clinical or physical findings, it was not possible to select the breasts in which the nipple and/or areola were not involved. It is concluded that the general use of surgical methods preserving the nipple and areola in treating breast cancer leaves a focus of invasive or intraductal carcinoma in about half the patients. The implications of this are not known.<p>

We studied the effects of resistive breathing in 10 patients with long-standing, severe disabling COPD. Small increases in inspiratory resistive load resulted in diaphragmatic fatigue and failure in all patients. Fatigue was detected using the frequency spectrum analysis of an EMG signal obtained with surface electrodes. Failure was defined as an inward displacement of the abdomen during inspiration, i.e. incoordination of thoracoabdominal motion. The patients trained for one half hour daily for 4 weeks, breathing into a simple device, where they inspired against a resistive load that produced some incoordinated breaths. After 4 weeks this load was increased, if possible, and another 4-week training period started. All patients improved with training, i.e. higher resistances could be tolerated without signs of fatigue and failure. In addition most patients claimed that training had helped them in their daily living; they were able to do more without getting short of breath. The device helped expectoration, possibly owing to the effect of the small expiratory resistance.<p>

We studied reinflation of collapsed parts in excised normal human lungs through both the ordinary bronchial route and through collateral channels. A model of atelectasis was made either by simple collapse or by applying a positive pressure to the pleura and a negative to the airway. Five different ventilatory patterns were used for reinflation: simulated normal breathing with and without continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), simulated deep breathing and mechanical ventilation with and without positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). All methods, except normal breathing without CPAP, reinflated the collapsed part with pressures well within the range used clinically. The most effective way of re-expanding collapsed lung was the application of CPAP during simulated normal breathing or PEEP during mechanical ventilation, which required smaller transpulmonary pressure swings than the other methods. A comparison between CPAP and PEEP showed CPAP to be preferable. Collateral reinflation occurred just as readily as normal reinflation and the results suggest that collateral reinflation is the primary choice. This route of reexpansion also has a potential secretion clearing effect in that pressure is built up distal to an obstruction.<p>

This study was undertaken to develop techniques for measuring absolute rates of sterol synthesis in extrahepatic tissues in vitro and to estimate the magnitude of the errors inherent in the use of various 14C-labeled substrates for such measurements. Initial studies showed that significant errors were introduced when rates of synthesis were estimated using [3H]water since about 20 nmol of water were bound to each mg of tissue cholesterol isolated as the digitonide. This source of error could be eliminated by subtracting apparent incorporation rates obtained at 0 degrees C from those obtained at 37 degrees C or by regenerating and drying the free sterol. In a second set of experiments, the H/C incorporation ratio in cholesterol was determined in the liver by measuring the absolute rates of hydrogen and acetyl CoA flux into sterols. The ratio of 0.69 +/- 0.03 was found to be independent of the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis, the rate of hepatic acetyl CoA generation, or the source of the acetyl CoA. In a third set of studies, rates of incorporation of [3H]water or 14C-labeled acetate, octanoate, and glucose into digitonin-precipitable sterols were simultaneously measured in nine different extrahepatic tissues. Assuming that the H/C ratio measured in the liver also applied to these tissues, the [3H]water incorporation rates were multipled by the reciprocal of the H/C ratio to give the absolute rates of sterol synthesis in each tissue. When these were compared to the incorporation rates determined with the 14C-labeled substrates the magnitude of the errors in the rates of sterol synthesis obtained with these substrates in each tissue could be assessed. Only [14C]octanoate gave synthesis rates approaching 100% of those obtained with [3H]water and this occurred only in the intestine and kidney; in the other extrahepatic tissues this substrate gave rates of 6--66+ of the absolute rates. Rates of [14C]acetate incorporation in sterols varied from 4 to 62% of the [3H]water incorporation rates while those obtained with [14C]glucose were only 2--88% of the true rates. These studies document the large and highly variable errors inherent in estimating rates of sterol synthesis in extrahepatic tissues using 14C-labeled substrates under in vitro conditions.<p>

The steady-state levels of plasma cholesterol carried in high and low density lipoproteins and in chylomicrons were varied over a wide range by use of a constant-infusion technique. After 40 hr, the rates of hepatic cholesterol synthesis and levels of hepatic cholesterol esters were measured and were related to the plasma level of each of the lipoprotein fractions. From the rates of infusion and the steady-state plasma levels attained, the whole animal clearance rates for cholesterol carried in low density and high density lipoproteins and in chylomicrons were calculated to be 0.53, 0.61, and 42.6 ml/hr, respectively. Hepatic cholesterol ester content increased by 0.8 mug/g for each 1.0 mg/dl increase in the steady-state level of plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol and by 1.4 mug/g for a similar elevation in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, the increase in ester content was 300-fold greater when chylomicrons were infused (330 mug/g). The rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis was inhibited by a factor of 0.004 and 0.007, respectively, per 1.0 mg/dl increase in the steady-state level of plasma cholesterol carried in either low density or high density lipoprotein but the inhibition was by a factor of 0.255, 50-fold greater, when chylomicrons were infused. Thus, in the steady state, cholesterol carried in either low density or high density lipoproteins is apparently taken up by the liver and regulates the rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis; however, cholesterol carried in chylomicrons is at least 50-fold more effective in this regard. This marked difference can be attributed to the much higher rates of transport of chylomicron cholesterol into the hepatocyte than of cholesterol carried in either low density or high density plasma lipoproteins.<p>

The effect of a single dose of suxamethonium on cardiac rate and rhythm during halothane anesthesia with babiturate induction was studied in a prospective, triple-blind trial with 28 patients. No atropine was given and patients were not intubated. A slight but significant preponderance of sinus-bradycardia without hemodynamic consequences was found in the group given suxamethonium. Suxamethonium did not provoke ventricular ectopies or conduction disturbances. It is concluded that in anesthesia with barbiturate induction, but without atropine or intubation, the use of a single dose of suxamethonium is a safe procedure with regard to cardiac rate and rhythm.<p>

One hundred and seven consecutive patients referred with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction were studied using cystometry and combined pressure-flow-electromyographic investigation. The symptoms of infravesical obstruction were not statistically significantly correlated to the hydrodynamic documentation of increased bladder outlet resistance as judged by maximum flow rate and the calculated urethral resistance. Irritative symptoms such as frequency, nocturia, urgency and urgeincontinence were statistically significantly correlated to the presence of detrusor hyperreflexia. The functional disorder bladder neck dyssynergia was encounterd in 5% of the patients (95% confidence limits 1-10%). This diagnosis cannot be made by conventional urological investigations. It is concluded that objective demonstration of infravesical obstruction is mandatory in the selection of patients with symptoms of lower urinary tract dysfunction for surgery on the prostate or the bladder neck.<p>

A methionyl-tRNA-Met-f deacylase was found in ribosomal salt wash from cultured human cells of the HeLa line. This enzyme was purified by the use of DEAE-cellulose, ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration and isoelectric focusing, and appears to be a protein with a native molecular weight of 80,000, which consists of two 40,000-Mr subunits. The mechanism of the Met-tRNA-Met-f deacylase is shown to involve end-product inhibition by the deacylated form of Met-tRNA-Met-f. The methionyl-tRNA-Met-f deacylase is rather specific for Met-tRNA-Met-f as opposed to Met-tRNA-Met-m, has a KCl optimum of 85 mM, is inhibited by MgCl2 and is inhibited by GTP and NAD+ at physiological concentration. 40-S and 60-S subunits inhibit the enzyme, possibly by binding to it. The stability of translational initiation complexes, containing methionyl-tRNA-Met-f, was investigated in the presence of the enzyme. Purified ternary complex was slowly broken down by the enzyme, while the 40-S-subunit . Met-tRNA-Met-f complex was stable in the presence of enzyme. The 80-S complex formed with A-U-G trinucleotide as the message molecule was broken down, whereas the 80-S complex formed with globin mRNA was stable in the presence of the enzyme. The physiological role of this enzyme is unclear, but it might act to regulate initiation by deacylating Met-tRNA-Met-f.<p>

This review of black and white human skin differences emphasizes the alleged importance of factors other than the obvious, i.e., skin color. Physicochemical differences and differences in susceptibility to irritants and allergens suggest a more resistant black than white skin. Differences appear to exist in the frequency of which several skin diseases occur among blacks and whites. A striking feature in this literature is the disagreement between authors.

Twenty patients on home peritoneal dialysis were studied during two years. The patients dialysed 4--5 times a week, using an average of 78 l dialysis fluid. The dialysis equipment used was either a simplified delivery system or a fully automatic dialysis machine. Despite clinical improvement, serum urea and serum creatinine levels were the same after 12 months of therapy as before. The patients' weight and serum albumin levels remained constant. Only 1 patient developed hyperparathyroidism, otherwise serum calcium levels ranged from normal to subnormal. Fifteen patients did not require blood transfusions. Twenty episodes of peritonitis occurred, an incidence of 0.58%. All patients carried out dialysis themselves without assistance. Three were working full-time, and 5 were able to look after their homes. The rest were able to take care of themselves. Four patients died from causes unrelated to peritoneal dialysis. In selected patients this mode of treatment provides an acceptable alternative to haemodialysis.<p>

The use of polyethylene glycol (mol. wt 4000) in a rapid radioassay for intrinsic factor is reported. The assay is based on the observation that polyethylene glycol precipitates the intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 complex in the presence of serum from patients with pernicious anaemia having auto-antibodies against intrinsic factor. The assay was found highly reproducible (CV 1.8%) and well correlated to the classical method using coated charcoal in the separation step.<p>

Pepsin had no effect on the vitamin B12 binder in human saliva (R-binder), while trypsin was found to reduce the apparent molecular weight of the R-binder and to release vitamin B12 from the R-B12complex of human saliva and human gastric juice (HGJ). Trypsin had no effect on the molecular weight and biological activity of intrinsic factor (IF) in HGJ, as demonstrated by gel filtration on Sephadex G-150 and the uptake of IF-B12 by guinea pig intestinal brush borders. An extract of purified guinea pig intestinal lysosomes was also without effect on the molecular weight and the biological activity of IF but was found to release vitamin B12 from the R-B12 complex. The results support the observation that the external pancreatic secretion corrects malabsorption of vitamin B12 by an effect on the non-IF protein in the intestinal juice. Moreover, the results indicate that lysosomal enzymes are not involved in the intestinal absorption of vitamin B12.<p>

cis-Diamminodichloroplatinum(II) (cis-PDD) and diaquoethylenediamineplatinum(II) induce histidine revertants in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 (frame-shift mutation) and TA100 (base-pair substitution mutation). A linear dose--response relationship is found with cis-PDD acting on TA98 and TA100. Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537 and TA1538 are not sensitive to the mutagenic action of cis-PDD. All 5 strains are sensitive to the toxic effect of cis-PDD. Platinum(II) complexes induce mutations (frame-shift or base-pair substitution) only in strains carrying the R-factor plasmid.<p>

A double-blind study of alprenolol versus placebo was done in patients with definite or suspected myocardial infarction to show the effect of the drug on mortality-rate after a year of treatment in patients aged less than or equal to 65 and to study the tolerance of the drug by patients greater than 65 years of age. The dose given was 5--10 mg intravenously, followed by 200 mg twice a day, orally. Patients in whom beta-blockade was contraindicated were excluded. All deaths, side-effects, and dropouts were recorded. Of the 480 patients in the study, 238 patients received alprenolol and 242 placebo. During the year of follow-up 108 patients dropped out from the study. Mortality was not reduced in patients greater than 65 years of age. In those less than or equal to 65 years alprenolol significantly reduced mortality-rate (20% mortality in placebo group vs 9% in treated group). There was also a significant reduction in mortality-rate among those with definite infarction (28% in the placebo vs 15% in the treated group).<p>

By means of the indirect immunofluorescence method smooth-muscle antibodies (SMA) were determined in 182 patients with various diseases and the findings were compared with those of 7 patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) and 580 normal controls. IgG-SMA were found in 85.7% of the patients with CAH, titres above 80 occurred only in Hepatitis B-associated antigen (HBAg)-negative CAH, but IgG-SMA in low titres were also found with increased incidence in syphilis (16.7%) and in infections of the central nervous system (19%). In other diseases (Sjogren's syndrome, ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis, myasthenia gravis, progressive muscular dystrophy, atopic dermatitis and mycoplasma pneumoniae infection) the prevalence did not differ from that of controls (3.6%). IgM-SMA were found more often in CAH (28.6%), in infections of the central nervous system (14.3%) and in the mycoplasma pneumoniae infections (13%) than in controls (2.6%), but titres above 20 occurred only in controls. IgA-SMA were detected only in a patient with syphilis. Demonstration of IgG-SMA titres above 80 seems to support the diagnosis of HBAg-negative CAH, while the demonstration of IgA- and IgM-SMA seems to be without diagnostic value in chronic hepatitis.<p>

In acute experiments in urethane-anaesthetized rabbits a small lesion at the septo-hippocampal border, from 0.8 to 1.5 mm from the midline, abolished theta activity ipsilaterally. This lesion severed fibres from the lateral part of the medial septal nucleus. Lesions of the main body of the fimbria or the dorsal fornix, alvear bundle and perforant path or the hippocampal commissures failed to change the dentate theta activity. Theta activity also survived the establishment of a 2 mm wide 'gate' near the rostral pole of the hippocampus; the gate was produced by cutting the main body of the fimbria and medially adjoining tissue and the dorsal fornix and laterally adjoining tissue. Cuts behind the 'gate' showed successive reduction of the dentate theta when the lesion passed beyond a threshold depth of about 1.5 mm. The degree of theta reduction appeared dependent upon the amount of the hippocampal tissue destroyed below this level. Thus, the fibres of importance for theta production seem to run through a bottleneck just behind the medial septum. Their further course is found in the basal part of the fimbria on its medial aspect and the adjoining parts of CA3 (lower blade) and hilus of the dentate fascia. Because the whole of this area had to be destroyed to block all theta activity, it is suggested that the fibres of importance for theta production are relatively dispersed within this region.<p>

Smooth-muscle antibodies (SMA) were investigated by the indirect immunofluorescence method and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) concentrations measured by radial immunodiffusion in 15 patients with hepatitis B antigen (HBAg)-positive and 20 patients with HBAg-negative acute hepatitis. In both types of hepatitis the serum IgM and IgG concentrations were significantly higher than in 55 controls, while the IgA levels were the same in patients and controls. IgM-SMA in titres of 10--80 occurred in 11 (55%) patients with HBAg-negative acute hepatitis, and this was significantly higher than in controls (P = 10(-8), whereas IgM-SMA were found in only 2 (13%) patients with HBAg-positive acute hepatitis. IgG-SMA occurred in 3 (15%) HBAg-negative and in 4 (27%) HBAg-positive patients. In HBAg-negative hepatitis the serum IgM concentrations were significantly higher in IgM-SMA-positive (mean: 439 mg/dl) than in IgM-SMA-negative (mean: 216 mg/dl) cases (P = 0.028). It was not possible to demonstrate a similar rleationship in HBAg-positive acute hepatitis. No correlation between the occurrence of IgG-SMA and the IgG levels could be demonstrated in acute hepatitis. It is assumed that IgM-SMA may account for a minor part of the elevated IgM levels in HBAg-negative acute hepatitis, but the reason for formation of SMA in acute viral hepatitis is not known.<p>

The reactivity of human smooth-muscle antibodies (SMA) with F- and G-actin was investigated by means of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Polystyrene tubes were coated with F-actin, G-actin and tropomyosin. The optimal reactivity of SMA with F-actin was achieved with tubes coated with actin concentrations in the range of 10-100 mug/ml, while both lower and higher amounts yielded lower reactivity. The reactivity with G-actin was low and only a little higher than the reactivity with tropomyosin or uncoated tubes, but much lower than the reactivity with F-actin. The differences in reactivity of SMA with F- and G-actin could not be explained by differences in binding of the two forms of actin to the tubes, although 1.7-2.5 times more F-actin than G-actin bound to the polystyrene surface after coating with equivalent amounts of protein. SMA-negative sera did not react with F-actin coated tubes indicating that the binding of antibody was not due to non-immunological binding of immunoglobulins. Human SMA thus react better with F- than with G-actin.<p>

A retrovirus previously isolated from a tumored Russell's viper is shown by molecular hybridization to be an endogenous virus of this reptilian species. Radio-immunologic techniques revealed that the viper retrovirus is immunologically and, hence, evolutionarily related to endogenous type D retorviruses of Old World primates. These findings extend the number of vertebrate classes possessing endogenous retroviruses and suggest that type D retroviruses may even be more widely distributed in nature than type C retroviruses.<p>

1. The cholinesterase (ChE) of frog brain and retina could be easily solubilized. About 10% of the brain and 20% of the retina ChE were found to be soluble in 0.05 M phosphate buffer. After treatment with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, about 30% of the total ChE activity of the brain and only 10% for retina was left particle bound. NaCl by itself did not solubilize ChE. Use of higher NaCl concentrations in combination with Triton X-100 as well as higher detergent concentrations alone seemed to cause an inhibiting effect of the solubilized ChE from retina. 2. The solubilized ChE from brain as well as retina were electrofocused as one main activity peak, corresponding to isoelectric points of pH 6.1 and 6.0, respectively. A second molecular form at pH 5.9 was distinguishable for the brain, but not for retina ChE. 3. Sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated that the ChE solubilized from the brain and retina consists of two molecular forms exhibiting S values of 5.1 +/- 0.24, 10.9 +/- 0.33 and 6.1 +/- 0.30, 10.9 +/- 0.43, respectively. After solubilization by higher Triton X-100 concentrations the soluble extracts from brain and retina seemed to contain the activity of these forms in different proportions. 4. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separated three molecular forms of the brain ChE. One of these forms was found to have a molecular weight of 394,000 +/- 20,000. The others were found to have an identical molecular weight of 550,000 +/- 10,000. Two molecular forms exhibiting molecular weights of 292,000 +/- 10,000 and 470,000 +/- 10,000, could be separated for retina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

Two hundred ninety-five Greenlanders, 5% of the population of Greenland, aged 40 years or more, were investigated regarding primary osteoarthrosis of the knee. The pathological changes were categorized as mild, intermediate, or severe. Eighty-six (29%) of the patients were found to have osteoarthrosis and the mild form accounted for 72% of these, while only one individual was found to have severe osteoarthrosis. Significantly more individuals from the West coast of Greenland (a mixed Eskimo-European population) than individuals from the East coast (genuine Eskimos) were found to have osteoarthrosis of the knee (38% and 18%, respectively). An investigation of the sex distribution revealed more soteoarthrosi among West coast women than among East coast women (P less than 0.05), whereas no such differences were found among the men. It was speculated that the difference between the rates of osteoarthrosis of the knee in the two population groups might reflect differences in occupation and possibly also a genetic predisposition.<p>

The seven histidines of bovine prolactin were modified with ethoxyformic anhydride and two classes of reactivity were apparent: 5 histidines were in the more reactive class (k = 0.097 min-1) and 2 histidines were less reactive (k = 0.011 min-1). The activity of the modified prolactins was determined by measuring their ability to bind to prolactin receptors from rabbit mammary glands. This assay showed that prolactin was fully active when 0 to 5 histidines were modified. If all 7 residues were modified, the hormone was unable to bind to its receptor. Circular dichroism studies indicated no significant differences in conformation for prolactins which had 2 to 7 histidines modified. Modification of human growth hormone and human placental lactogen with ethoxyformic anhydride resulted in a loss of the ability of these lactogenic hormones to bind to the prolactin receptor. For all three hormones, essentially full activity was recovered when the modifying group was removed by treatment with hydroxylamine. Sequence comparisons indicate that only 2 of the 3 growth hormone histidines and 2 of 7 placental lactogen histidines were homologous with histidines in bovine prolactin and that, in each case, they correspond to His-27 and His-30 in bovine prolactin. It is postulated that these residues serve to identify a portion of the binding domain of bovine prolactin.<p>

Activation of primed rabbit PBL by homologous antigen in the early proliferative phase (on days 3--5) mainly involves lymphocytes which neither secrete specific antibody nor contain immunoglobulin in their cell membrane. This stimulation is antigen-specific, and evidence is given that the major proportion of these cells are T lymphocytes. The B cells forming Av-CHO-specific PFC were studied by autoradiography on days 6 and 12 of culture. Since incorporation of radioactive thymidine was found in the majority of PFC, these cells are also in proliferation.<p>

Anderson, J. F. (1978). &quot;Energy content of spider eggs.&quot; <u>Oecologia</u> <b>37</b>(1): 41-57.<p>
The energy content of spider eggs was determined on samples from 12 species representing 6 families. These values ranged from 26.32 to 29.00 joules per mg ash-free dry mass with a mean of 27.30+/-SE of 0.27. The higher values were found in those species that overwinter as developmental stages within the egg sac. Rates of energy expenditure of developing eggs and spiderlings within the egg sac were only 7 to 19% of those of emerged spiderlings. The energy conserved by this reduction in rate of metabolism may facilitate survival without feeding during the potentially long periods of aerial dispersal by ballooning, a characteristic activity of most newly emerged spiderlings. The variation in mass-specific energy content is less than variation in clutch size and individual egg size on an intra-and interspecific basis. There was no correlation between energy content per unit egg mass and size of the female parent, egg size, or clutch size. Further analysis indicated that no single measure such as clutch size accurately represents the proportional amount of energy invested in reproduction in these animals.<p>

The vitelline body in the mature oocyte of the spider Tegenaria parietina is composed of 4 different zones. 1. The central zone contains granular areas, vesicles, and a few lamellae. 2. The lamellar zone consists of numerous concentric lamellae. These sheets, 45 A in thickness, are stacked in groups. The fine structure and the regular arrangement recall those of myelin sheets, retinal rods, and chloroplasts. Between the stacks of lamellae, finely granular masses and various vesicles are to be found. 3. The &quot;zone of transition&quot; consists of a finely granular substance accumulated in abundant masses. This substance is composed of very closely packed granules about 50 to 60 A in diameter. Very often, near the lamellae, the granules show alignment giving a gradual transition from grains to lamellae. 4. The vesicular zone contains ergastoplasm, dense particles, mitochondria, and Golgi material. It is suggested that the peculiar ultrastructure of these cytoplasmic components may be related to an intense metabolic activity.<p>

Andreas, S., et al. (1996). &quot;Cheyne-Stokes respiration and prognosis in congestive heart failure.&quot; <u>American Journal of Cardiology</u> <b>78</b>(11): 1260-1264.<p>
Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) frequently demonstrate Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) with repetitive arousals and oxygen desaturations during sleep. Although it was evident from early publications that CSR during the daytime is a poor prognostic indicator in patients with CHF, it was speculated recently that CSR occurring during sleep could impede left ventricular function and even survival. We therefore followed up 36 patients with CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; or = 40% who underwent a sleep study at our institution. The patients showed a reduced ejection fraction (20 +/- 8%) and CSR with a median of 19% of total sleep time (lower and upper quartiles 9% and 56%). In 12 +/- 9% of their time in bed, the arterial oxygen saturation was &lt;90%. No patient was lost to follow-up, which lasted for 32 +/- 15 months (range 11 to 53). One-year survival was 86 +/- 6%, and 2-year survival was 66 +/- 8%. Univariate comparisons for survival between groups stratified by the amount of CSR revealed no significant difference (log rank test, p = 0.84). However, the 20 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;20% had a shorter mean survival time than patients with an ejection fraction &gt;20% (9.5 vs 28.3 months; log rank test, p = 0.013). Two patients with CSR during the daytime died within 1 month. No other patient had CSR during the daytime, and only 1 patient without daytime CSR died within 1 month (chi-square test, p &lt;0.001). Higher age, reduced carbon dioxide end-tidal partial pressure, and increased transit time were found to be significantly related to the amount of nocturnal CSR. In conclusion, CSR occurring during sleep has no important prognostic impact in patients with CHF, but CSR present during the daytime suggests a high likelihood of dying within a few months.<p>

INTRODUCTION: The new WHO growth standards, were the result of a multicenter growth reference study, performed on a sample of children with rigorous criteria of health, with families that had complied with the health recommendations that are made in the field of breastfeeding and not smoking. OBJECTIVE: To compare the argentine references with the WHO standard for the anthropometric evaluation of a population of children under 5 years. POPULATION: 474 children younger than 5 years old who attended the Municipal Health Centers during October 2004. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Children were weighed and measured with instruments and techniques standardized by SAP. The study design was observational, cross-sectional, descriptive. We used EPI6/ ANTCONV for Argentine reference and ANTRHRO 2005 for WHO standard T test for two samples, P (T &lt; t) two tails, and Chi 2. RESULTS: Total 474, 231 boys and 243 girls. Height/ age minor - 2 DS: Argentine reference= 39 (8.2%) and WHO= 58 (12.2%), not significant. Weight/age minor -2DS: Argentine reference= 24 (5.1%) and WHO= 10 (Chi 2 p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: WHO standards, from 12 months on, selected the largest number of children with short stature, and, regarding weight, it happened the opposite, they selected less children with low weight/age.<p>

Cuticular hydrocarbons of larvae of individual strains of the Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto were investigated using gas liquid chromatography. Biomedical discriminant analysis involving multivariate statistics suggests that there was clear hydrocarbon difference between the Gambian(G3), the Nigerian (16CSS and, its malathion resistant substrain, REFMA) and the Tanzanian (KWA) strains. The high degree of segregation (95%) in hydrocarbons among the four strains investigated indicates that further analysis is needed to enable understanding of hydrocarbon variation in samples of An. gambiae especially from areas where these populations co-exist.<p>

Mutations in the MID1 protein have been found in patients with Opitz BBB/G syndrome (OS), which is characterised by multiple malformations of the ventral midline. MID1 is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules and, in association with the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), alpha4, provides ubiquitin ligase activity for the ubiquitin-specific modification of PP2A. Using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technology, we show here that MID1 is actively and bi-directionally transported along the microtubules, and that this movement is directly linked to its MAP kinase and PP2A-mediated phosphorylation status. Intact transport depends on both kinesins and dyneins and is inhibited upon colcemide treatments. MID1 proteins carrying missense mutations in the alpha4 binding domain still bind the microtubules but cannot be actively transported. Likewise, knock-down of the alpha4 protein, inhibition of PP2A activity by okadaic acid and fostriecin or the simulation of permanent phosphorylation at Ser96 in MID1 stop the migration of MID1-GFP, while preserving its microtubule-association. In summary, our data uncover an unexpected and novel function for PP2A, its regulatory subunit alpha4 and PP2A/alpha4/mTOR signaling in the active transport of the MID1 ubiquitin ligase complex along the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, a failure in the microtubule directed transport of this protein complex would be an attractive mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of OS in patients with B-box1 mutations.<p>

The use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the purpose of repeated follow-up examination of bone marrow samples from 38 leukemia patients was investigated. On the basis of conventional cytogenetic analysis, patients with acute leukemia whose leukemic cells carried numerical chromosomal aberrations were selected and followed with repetitive DNA probes that specifically hybridize to one chromosome type. Repeated cytogenetic metaphase analyses would have been laborious and not sensitive or quantitative enough to follow declining numbers of aberrant cells. FISH, as an interphase cytogenetic technique, provides a rapid and simple alternative with high sensitivity. Although FISH data before and after chemotherapy were in agreement with bone marrow cytology in 30 of 38 patients, discrepancies were noticed in specific cases. These could be explained by the presence of cytogenetically distinct subclones that behave differently during treatment, the presence of differentiated leukemic cells, changes in the chromosomal constitution caused by clonal relapse, or the fact that a numerical aberration is found by conventional chromosome banding analysis while the target region to which the probe is directed is still present in the nucleus as a diploid set.<p>

In this paper we review the current status of research on fatty acid absorption and conversion to diacylglycerol in the midgut. We further discuss how diacylglycerol may leave the midgut and associate with lipophorin in hemolymph. We review the present understanding of the role of the lipid transfer particle and lipophorin receptors in lipid delivery between lipophorin and tissues. Finally, we discuss recent studies on the mobilization of diacylglycerol from the fat body in response to adipokinetic hormone. Several suggestions for exciting areas of future research are described.<p>

In this report we show the existence of a distinct pool of fat body diacylglycerol (DG) that can be distinguished from the bulk DG. This is a dynamic pool of DG that uses FA entering the fat body from the hemolymph, whereas the bulk DG uses the fatty acids stored in the fat body fat droplets. Using a dual labeling technique, it was possible to compare the effect of hormone-stimulated DG synthesis and secretion on the distribution of radiolabeled FA among the lipids of the dynamic pool (short-term radiolabeling), with the hormonal effect on the total complement of fat body lipids (long-term radiolabeling). We observed that, whereas DG represents 2% to 3% of the fat body lipid mass, about 20% of the short-term radiolabeled lipids are represented by DG. Stimulation of lipolysis produces a fast decrease in the fraction of short-term radiolabeled DG, whereas there is an increase in the mass of fat body DG. The subcellular distribution of bulk DG showed that its majority (62%) was in the fat cake whereas only 2.9% was in the cytosol. On lipolysis stimulation, the largest changes in specific activities of newly synthesized DG were detected in the cytosol and the fat cake, suggesting that newly synthesized DG localized in the lipid droplets and the cytosol is preferentially mobilized.<p>

The fat body plays major roles in the life of insects. It is a dynamic tissue involved in multiple metabolic functions. One of these functions is to store and release energy in response to the energy demands of the insect. Insects store energy reserves in the form of glycogen and triglycerides in the adipocytes, the main fat body cell. Insect adipocytes can store a great amount of lipid reserves as cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Lipid metabolism is essential for growth and reproduction and provides energy needed during extended nonfeeding periods. This review focuses on energy storage and release and summarizes current understanding of the mechanisms underlying these processes in insects.<p>

UNLABELLED: Endogenous synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) and its presence in exhaled air was observed in various species including humans. Particularly high levels were found in adults with bronchial asthma, possibly because of the underlying pulmonary inflammatory activity. We studied oral and nasal exhaled NO by chemiluminescence in 47 children aged between 6 and 10 years. Thirty children had bronchial asthma, 17 were healthy controls. In asthmatic children oral exhaled NO was 13.4 +/- 1.4 parts per billion (ppb) (mean +/- SEM), nasal exhaled NO was 21.7 +/- 1.5 ppb. In healthy controls oral exhaled NO was 7.2 +/0 1.0 ppb, nasal exhaled NO was 18.2 +/- 22 ppb. Oral exhaled NO was significantly higher in asthmatic children compared to healthy controls (P = 0.0017). Nasal exhaled NO did not differ significantly in the two groups. There was a significant negative correlation between oral exhaled NO and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FeV1). No significant correlation between oral or nasal exhaled NO and other markers of obstructive lung function impairment, oral minute ventilation, the body mass index and the presence of upper respiratory tract infection could be found. CONCLUSION: Children with bronchial asthma have significantly higher levels of orally exhaled nitric oxide than healthy controls.<p>

In triatomines, as well as in other insects, accumulation of yolk is a process in which an extra-ovarian tissue, the fat body, produces yolk proteins that are packed in the egg. The main protein, synthesized by the fat body, which is accumulated inside the oocyte, is vitellogenin. This process is also known as vitellogenesis. There are growing evidences in triatomines that besides fat body the ovary also produces yolk proteins. The way these yolk proteins enter the oocyte will be discussed. Yolk is a complex material composed of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and other minor components which are packed inside the oocyte in an organized manner. Fertilization triggers embryogenesis, a process where an embryo will develop. During embryogenesis the yolk will be used for the construction of a new individual, the first instar nymph. The challenge for the next decade is to understand how and where these egg proteins are used up together with their non-protein components, in pace with the genetic program of the embryo, which enables cell differentiation (early phase of embryogenesis) and embryo differentiation (late phase) inside the egg.<p>

Vitellin (Vt) was purified from ovary extracts of mature females of the banana shrimp Litopenaeus merguiensis using DEAE-Sephacel and Superdex 200 columns. Native Vt had an apparent molecular mass of 398 kDa as determined by native PAGE and by gel filtration chromatography. Under reducing and denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE), Vt is composed of two major subunits of 87 and 78 kDa, although some faint bands were also detected. The N-terminal 10 amino acids sequence of the 78 kDa subunit is identical to that of Litopenaeus vannamei Vt and very similar to that of Litopenaeus japonicus vitellogenin (Vg) as well as Litopenaeus semisulcatus Vt, with an identity of 89%. Anti-Vt polyclonal antibody raised against purified Vt shows a high specificity with only ovarian Vt and hemolymph Vg of vitellogenic shrimps in double immunodiffusion and Western blot assays. Vg and Vt concentrations in hemolymph, hepatopancreas and ovaries were measured by ELISA. Vg concentrations increased in the hemolymph in the early stages of ovarian development and declined in the maturation stages. As there were undetectable concentrations of Vg in the hepatopancreas while an elevation of Vg levels occurred in the hemolymph, during the time that Vt was accumulating in the ovaries during oogenesis, this would suggest that the contribution of Vg synthesized by the hepatopancreas only might be not sufficient for adequate development of the oocytes in the banana shrimp L. merguiensis during vitellogenesis.<p>

The transport of oxygen in the hemolymph of many arthropod and mollusc species is mediated by large copper-proteins that are referred to as hemocyanins. Arthropod hemocyanins are composed of hexamers and oligomers of hexamers. Arachnid hemocyanins usually form 4 x 6-mers consisting of seven distinct subunit types (termed a-g), although in some spider taxa deviations from this standard scheme have been observed. Applying immunological and electrophoretic methods, six distinct hemocyanin subunits were identified in the red-legged golden orb-web spider Nephila inaurata madagascariensis (Araneae: Tetragnathidae). The complete cDNA sequences of six subunits were obtained that corresponded to a-, b-, d-, e-, f- and g-type subunits. No evidence for a c-type subunit was found in this species. The inclusion of the N. inaurata hemocyanins in a multiple alignment of the arthropod hemocyanins and the application of the Bayesian method of phylogenetic inference allow, for the first time, a solid reconstruction of the intramolecular evolution of the chelicerate hemocyanin subunits. The branch leading to subunit a diverged first, followed by the common branch of the dimer-forming b and c subunits, while subunits d and f, as well as subunits e and g form common branches. Assuming a clock-like evolution of the chelicerate hemocyanins, a timescale for the evolution of the Chelicerata was obtained that agrees with the fossil record.<p>

Lipid peroxidation can be described generally as a process under which oxidants such as free radicals attack lipids containing carbon-carbon double bond(s), especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Over the last four decades, an extensive body of literature regarding lipid peroxidation has shown its important role in cell biology and human health. Since the early 1970s, the total published research articles on the topic of lipid peroxidation was 98 (1970-1974) and has been increasing at almost 135-fold, by up to 13165 in last 4 years (2010-2013). New discoveries about the involvement in cellular physiology and pathology, as well as the control of lipid peroxidation, continue to emerge every day. Given the enormity of this field, this review focuses on biochemical concepts of lipid peroxidation, production, metabolism, and signaling mechanisms of two main omega-6 fatty acids lipid peroxidation products: malondialdehyde (MDA) and, in particular, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), summarizing not only its physiological and protective function as signaling molecule stimulating gene expression and cell survival, but also its cytotoxic role inhibiting gene expression and promoting cell death. Finally, overviews of in vivo mammalian model systems used to study the lipid peroxidation process, and common pathological processes linked to MDA and 4-HNE are shown.<p>

Organisms evolve two routes to surviving infections-they can resist pathogen growth (resistance) and they can endure the pathogenesis of infection (tolerance). The sum of these two properties together defines the defensive capabilities of the host. Typically, studies of animal defenses focus on either understanding resistance or, to a lesser extent, tolerance mechanisms, thus providing little understanding of the relationship between these two mechanisms. We suggest there are nine possible pairwise permutations of these traits, assuming they can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in an independent manner. Here we show that by making a single mutation in the gene encoding a protease, CG3066, active in the melanization cascade in Drosophila melanogaster, we observe the full spectrum of changes; these mutant flies show increases and decreases in their resistance and tolerance properties when challenged with a variety of pathogens. This result implicates melanization in fighting microbial infections and shows that an immune response can affect both resistance and tolerance to infections in microbe-dependent ways. The fly is often described as having an unsophisticated and stereotypical immune response where single mutations cause simple binary changes in immunity. We report a level of complexity in the fly's immune response that has strong ecological implications. We suggest that immune responses are highly tuned by evolution, since selection for defenses that alter resistance against one pathogen may change both resistance and tolerance to other pathogens.<p>

An 86-year-old patient was transferred to our institution with acute respiratory distress. A tension pneumothorax was suspected, but needle decompression was unsuccessful. Instead of the suspected pneumothorax, the chest radiograph revealed a large 'tension gastrothorax'. In a matter of seconds, the insertion of a nasogastric tube resulted in drastic improvement of the critical clinical state. Acute tension gastrothorax is a rare, but classic, complication of paraoesophageal hernias. Its clinical presentation can be dramatic and rapidly lethal, immediate action is therefore warranted. Nasograstric tube insertion is a life saving procedure to be undertaken without delay. However, tension gastrothorax is a rare entity. Therefore, if tension pneumothorax is suspected, needle decompression should not be delayed.<p>

Phosphorylation is involved in numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, alpha-synuclein is extensively phosphorylated in aggregates in patients suffering from synucleinopathies. However, the share of this modification in the events that lead to the conversion of alpha-synuclein to aggregated toxic species needed to be clarified. The rat model that we developed through rAAV2/6-mediated expression of alpha-synuclein demonstrates a correlation between neurodegeneration and formation of small filamentous alpha-synuclein aggregates. A mutation preventing phosphorylation (S129A) significantly increases alpha-synuclein toxicity and leads to enhanced formation of beta-sheet-rich, proteinase K-resistant aggregates, increased affinity for intracellular membranes, a disarrayed network of neurofilaments and enhanced alpha-synuclein nuclear localization. The expression of a mutation mimicking phosphorylation (S129D) does not lead to dopaminergic cell loss. Nevertheless, fewer but larger aggregates are formed, and signals of apoptosis are also activated in rats expressing the phosphorylation-mimicking form of alpha-synuclein. These observations strongly suggest that phosphorylation does not play an active role in the accumulation of cytotoxic pre-inclusion aggregates. Unexpectedly, the study also demonstrates that constitutive expression of phosphorylation-mimicking forms of alpha-synuclein does not protect from neurodegeneration. The role of phosphorylation at Serine 129 in the early phase of Parkinson's disease is examined, which brings new perspective to therapeutic approaches focusing on the modulation of kinases/phosphatases activity to control alpha-synuclein toxicity.<p>

PBDEs (congeners 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154, 183, 209), HBCD (alpha, beta, gamma), emerging brominated flame retardants (PBEB, HBB and DBDPE), dechloranes (Dec 602, 603, 604, syn- and anti-DP), TBBPA, 2,4,6-TBP and MeO-PBDEs (8 congeners) were analysed in commercial seafood samples from European countries. Levels were similar to literature and above the environmental quality standards (EQS) limit of the Directive 2013/39/EU for PBDEs. Contaminants were found in 90.5% of the seafood samples at n. d.-356 ng/g lw (n. d.-41.1 ng/g ww). DBDPE was not detected and 2,4,6-TBP was detected only in mussels, but at levels comparable to those of PBDEs. Mussel and seabream were the most contaminated species and the Mediterranean Sea (FAO Fishing Area 37) was the most contaminated location. The risk assessment revealed that there was no health risk related to the exposure to brominated flame retardants via seafood consumption. However, a refined risk assessment for BDE-99 is of interest in the future. Moreover, the cooking process concentrated PBDEs and HBB.<p>

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to characterize the clinical, echocardiographic and angiographic findings in patients who have regional wall motion abnormalities predictive of coronary artery disease on dobutamine stress echocardiograms, although coronary angiography reveals no critical stenoses. BACKGROUND: The specificity of dobutamine stress echocardiography has been reported to be lower than its sensitivity; the sources of false positive findings on dobutamine stress echocardiograms have not been previously defined. METHODS: Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were retrospectively reviewed for patients who had both a dobutamine stress echocardiogram indicative of coronary artery disease on the basis of wall motion abnormalities and &lt; 50% stenoses reported on coronary angiography performed within 6 weeks of the echocardiogram. A 16-segment model was used to perform wall motion scoring. Angiograms were independently reviewed, and stenosis severity was quantified with the use of digital calipers. RESULTS: Thirty-nine (11.4%) of 342 studies met criteria for false positive test results, which occurred predominantly in women (72%, p &lt; 0.001). Regional wall motion abnormalities were evident more often in the posterior circulation (62%), and 65% of them were limited to the basal segments. Twelve (28%) of 43 wall motion abnormalities were associated with coronary stenoses of at least intermediate grade (lumen diameter 40.3% to 68.1%). Abnormalities confined to basal segments of the posterior circulation were unlikely to have associated coronary lesions (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: False positive findings on dobutamine stress echocardiograms tend to involve small wall motion abnormalities that are frequently located in basal segments of the posterior myocardial circulation. Approximately one third of false positive results occurred in patients with intermediate-grade coronary stenoses, and these studies may reflect true inducible ischemia. Additional sources of false positive study results may include poor endocardial visualization and abnormal motion due to tethering to the fibrous skeleton of the heart. Altered echocardiographic diagnostic criteria may be appropriate for small wall motion abnormalities confined to basal segments of the posterior circulation.<p>

In order to relate histopathological findings of the kidney in systemic vasculitis to renal outcome, scoring of various morphological parameters is necessary. Therefore, we conducted a standardization study for evaluating renal biopsies from patients with systemic vasculitis. Four experienced renal pathologists from four European centres joined in the study. A scoring protocol was devised that required the observers to score an extensive number of histopathological lesions either quantitatively (as a percentage of the total number of glomeruli) or dichotomously (on a present/absent scale). Twenty renal biopsies were scored individually by all the observers, from which the inter-observer variability was analysed. Ten randomly chosen biopsies were scored again, in order to obtain the intra-observer variability. For inter-observer agreement, the evaluation of the quantitative variables was satisfactory for both rounds (0.55 &lt; or = Kendall's W &lt; or = 0.95 and 0.59 &lt; or = W &lt; or = 0.96, respectively, with all P &lt; 0.05). However, the inter-observer agreement for the dichotomous data was poor (kappa &lt; or = 0.30 in more than half of the parameters in both rounds). Also the data on intra-observer agreement showed more favourable results for the analysis of the quantitative data (Pearson's r &gt; 0.45 in more than 85% of the variables in both rounds) than for the dichotomous scoring system (kappa &lt; or = 0.30 in more than half of the variables). It is concluded that even between experienced renal pathologists discrepancies occur in scoring kidney biopsies. Inter- and intra-observer agreement is greater if a quantitative method for reviewing the biopsies is applied that requires the observers to score the tissue specimens systematically.<p>

Hemocyanins are large copper-containing respiratory proteins found in many arthropod species. Scorpions and orthognath spiders possess a highly conserved 4 x 6-mer hemocyanin that consists of at least seven distinct subunit types (termed a to g). However, many &quot;modern&quot; entelegyne spiders such as Cupiennius salei differ from the standard arachnid scheme and have 2 x 6-mer hemocyanins. Here we report the complete primary structure of the 2 x 6-mer hemocyanin of C. salei as deduced from cDNA sequencing, gel electrophoresis, and matrix-assisted laser desorption spectroscopy. Six distinct subunit types (1 through 6) and three additional allelic sequences were identified. Each 1 x 6-mer half-molecule most likely is composed of subunits 1-6, with subunit 1 linking the two hexamers via a disulfide bridge located in a C-terminal extension. The C. salei hemocyanin subunits all belong to the arachnid g-type, whereas the other six types (a-f) have been lost in evolution. The reconstruction of a complex hemocyanin from a single g-type subunit, which commenced about 190 million years ago and was completed about 90 million years ago, might be explained by physiological and behavioral changes that occurred during the evolution of the entelegyne spiders.<p>

More than 500 compounds chosen to represent kinase inhibitor space have been screened against a panel of over 200 protein kinases. Significant results include the identification of hits against new kinases including PIM1 and MPSK1, and the expansion of the inhibition profiles of several literature compounds. A detailed analysis of the data through the use of affinity fingerprints has produced findings with implications for biological target selection, the choice of tool compounds for target validation, and lead discovery and optimization. In a detailed examination of the tyrosine kinases, interesting relationships have been found between targets and compounds. Taken together, these results show how broad cross-profiling can provide important insights to assist kinase drug discovery.<p>

Our previous studies have shown that treatment with an alpha4beta1 integrin blocking antibody after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rats decreases intraspinal inflammation and oxidative damage, improving neurological function. Here, we studied effects of a high affinity small molecule alpha4beta1 inhibitor, BIO5192. First, rats were treated intravenously with BIO5192 (10 mg/kg) or with vehicle (controls) to assess effects of integrin blockade for 24 h or 72 h after thoracic clip-compression SCI. BIO5192 treatment significantly decreased the MPO enzymatic activity (neutrophil infiltration) and ED-1 expression (macrophage density) by 40% and 38% at 24 h and by 52% and 25% at 72 h post injury, respectively. In cord homogenates, BIO5192 treatment decreased expression of the oxidative enzymes gp91(phox), inducible nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2 by approximately 40% at both times of analysis. Free radical concentration decreased by 30% and lipid peroxidation decreased by 34% and 46%, respectively, at 24 h and 72 h after SCI. Next, after blockade by BIO5192 for 72 h, neurological outcomes were analyzed for 1-6 weeks after SCI. Motor function significantly improved when assessed by an open-field test. Treated rats planter placed their hind paws and/or dorsal stepped, with weight support, whereas controls only swept their hindlimbs. BIO5192 treatment also decreased mechanical allodynia elicited from the trunk and hind paw by up to 35%. This improved function correlated with decreased lesion size and spared myelin-containing white matter. The neurological improvement offered by this neuroprotective strategy supports the potential for an anti-integrin treatment for SCI.<p>

Seafood consumption is a major route for human exposure to environmental contaminants of emerging concern (CeCs). However, toxicological information about the presence of CeCs in seafood is still insufficient, especially considering the effect of cooking procedures on contaminant levels. This study is one among a few who evaluated the effect of steaming on the levels of different CeCs (toxic elements, PFCs, PAHs, musk fragrances and UV-filters) in commercially relevant seafood in Europe, and estimate the potential risks associated with its consumption for consumers. In most cases, an increase in contaminant levels was observed after steaming, though varying according to contaminant and seafood species (e.g. iAs, perfluorobutanoate, dibenzo(ah)anthracene in Mytilus edulis, HHCB-Lactone in Solea sp., 2-Ethylhexyl salicylate in Lophius piscatorius). Furthermore, the increase in some CeCs, like Pb, MeHg, iAs, Cd and carcinogenic PAHs, in seafood after steaming reveals that adverse health effects can never be excluded, regardless contaminants concentration. However, the risk of adverse effects can vary. The drastic changes induced by steaming suggest that the effect of cooking should be integrated in food risk assessment, as well as accounted in CeCs regulations and recommendations issued by food safety authorities, in order to avoid over/underestimation of risks for consumer health.<p>

An updated version of the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging (MFRTA) and longevity is reviewed. Key aspects of the theory are emphasized. Another main focus concerns common misconceptions that can mislead investigators from other specialties, even to wrongly discard the theory. Those different issues include (i) the main reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating site in the respiratory chain in relation to aging and longevity: complex I; (ii) the close vicinity or even contact between that site and the mitochondrial DNA, in relation to the lack of local efficacy of antioxidants and to sub-cellular compartmentation; (iii) the relationship between mitochondrial ROS production and oxygen consumption; (iv) recent criticisms on the MFRTA; (v) the widespread assumption that ROS are simple &quot;by-products&quot; of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; (vi) the unnecessary postulation of &quot;vicious cycle&quot; hypotheses of mitochondrial ROS generation which are not central to the free radical theory of aging; and (vii) the role of DNA repair concerning endogenous versus exogenous damage. After considering the large body of data already available, two general characteristics responsible for the high maintenance degree of long-lived animals emerge: (i) a low generation rate of endogenous damage: and (ii) the possession of tissue macromolecules that are highly resistant to oxidative modification.<p>

As the recipient list for patients requiring lung transplantation continues to increase, cadaveric donor lung availability has remained static. Our experience with utilizing lobes from living related donors for bilateral pulmonary transplantation in 20 patients has yielded a 75% survival at 1 year follow-up. Morbidity and mortality have been predominately due to infection. Rejection episodes have been mild and unilateral and have responded to augmented corticosteroids. Pulmonary function tests in the recipients tend to improve steadily during the first year postoperatively, and the patients have excellent functional capacity. There have been no significant complications in the donors. On the basis of our clinical experience, we have found that bilateral lobar transplantation utilizing living related donors has resulted in organ availability that can be lifesaving in critically ill patients and can provide a good alternative in certain noncritical, deteriorating patients.<p>

AIMS: To investigate the combination of heart rate turbulence (HRT) and deceleration capacity (DC) as risk predictors in post-infarction patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 30%. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 2343 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction (MI) (&lt;76 years) in sinus rhythm. HRT and DC were obtained from 24 h Holter recordings. Patients with both abnormal HRT (slope &lt; or = 2.5 ms/RR and onset &gt; or = 0%) and abnormal DC (&lt; or =4.5 ms) were considered suffering from severe autonomic failure (SAF) and prospectively classified as high risk. Primary and secondary endpoints were all-cause, cardiac, and sudden cardiac mortality within the first 5 years of follow-up. During follow-up, 181 patients died; 39 deaths occurred in 120 patients with LVEF &lt; or = 30%, and 142 in 2223 patients with LVEF&gt;30% (cumulative 5-year mortality rates of 37.9% and 7.8%, respectively). Among patients with LVEF &gt; 30%, SAF identified another high-risk group of 117 patients with 37 deaths (cumulative 5-year mortality rates of 38.6% and 6.1%, respectively). Merging both high-risk groups (i.e. LVEF &lt; or = 30% and/or SAF) doubled the sensitivity of mortality prediction compared with LVEF &lt; or = 30% alone (21.1% vs. 42.1%, P &lt; 0.001) while preserving 5-year mortality rate (38.2%). CONCLUSION: In post-MI patients with LVEF&gt;30%, SAF identifies a high-risk group equivalent in size and mortality risk to patients with LVEF &lt; or = 30%.<p>

This consensus statement has been compiled on behalf of the International Society for Holter and Noninvasive Electrophysiology. It reviews the topic of heart rate turbulence (HRT) and concentrates on technologies for measurement, physiologic background and interpretation, and clinical use of HRT. It also lists suggestions for future research. The phenomenon of HRT refers to sinus rhythm cycle-length perturbations after isolated premature ventricular complexes. The physiologic pattern of HRT consists of brief heart rate acceleration (quantified by the so-called turbulence onset) followed by more gradual heart rate deceleration (quantified by the so-called turbulence slope) before the rate returns to a pre-ectopic level. Available physiologic investigations confirm that the initial heart rate acceleration is triggered by transient vagal inhibition in response to the missed baroreflex afferent input caused by hemodynamically inefficient ventricular contraction. A sympathetically mediated overshoot of arterial pressure is responsible for the subsequent heart rate deceleration through vagal recruitment. Hence, the HRT pattern is blunted in patients with reduced baroreflex. The HRT pattern is influenced by a number of factors, provocations, treatments, and pathologies reviewed in this consensus. As HRT measurement provides an indirect assessment of baroreflex, it is useful in those clinical situations that benefit from baroreflex evaluation. The HRT evaluation has thus been found appropriate in risk stratification after acute myocardial infarction, risk prediction, and monitoring of disease progression in heart failure, as well as in several other pathologies.<p>

Defensins are a major family of antimicrobial peptides found throughout the phylogenetic tree. From the spider species: Cupiennius salei, Phoneutria reidyi, Polybetes pythagoricus, Tegenaria atrica, and Meta menardi, defensins belonging to the 'ancestral' class of invertebrate defensins were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences contain the characteristic six cysteines of this class of defensins and reveal precursors of 60 or 61 amino acid residues. The mature peptides consist of 37 amino acid residues, showing up to 70% identities with tick and scorpion defensins. In C. salei, defensin mRNA was found to be constitutively expressed in hemocytes, ovaries, subesophageal nerve mass, hepatopancreas, and muscle tissue. This is the first report presenting and comparing antimicrobial peptides belonging to the family of defensins from spiders.<p>

METHODS: Rabbits received 15, 50, 150 mg/kg/day (mkd) d-MPH or 20, 60, 200, 300 mkd d,l-MPH on gestation days 7-20. Rats received 2.5, 10, 40 mkd d-MPH, or 7, 25, 75, 80 mkd d,l-MPH on gestation days 6-17. RESULTS: d-MPH-In rabbits, mortality occurred at 150 mkd. Dilated pupils, increased activity, biting/chewing, respiration, and salivation occurred at &gt;or=15 mkd in rabbits and &gt;or=10 mkd in rats. Decreased food consumption occurred at 40 mkd in rats. Decreased body weight parameters occurred at 150 mkd in rabbits and &gt;or=10 mkd in rats. There were no fetal findings in rabbits. In rats, skeletal variations occurred at 40 mkd. d,l-MPH-In rabbits, mortality occurred at &gt;or=200 mkd. Dilated pupils, increased activity, biting/chewing, respiration, and salivation occurred at &gt;or=20 mkd in rabbits and &gt;or=25 mkd in rats. Decreased food consumption occurred at &gt;or=200 mkd in rabbits and &gt;or=25 mkd in rats. Decreased body weight parameters occurred at &gt;or=200 mkd in rabbits and &gt;or=25 mkd in rats. In rabbits, two fetuses (separate litters) had spina bifida and malrotated hindlimbs at 200 mkd. In rats, skeletal variations occurred at &gt;or=75 mkd. CONCLUSIONS: There was no teratogenicity with d-MPH. There was a low teratogenic risk with d,l-MPH in only the rabbit. Higher C(max) may explain differences in results from previous studies.<p>

Selection pressure exerted by insects and microorganisms shapes the diversity of plant secondary metabolites. We identified a metabolic pathway for glucosinolates, known insect deterrents, that differs from the pathway activated by chewing insects. This pathway is active in living plant cells, may contribute to glucosinolate turnover, and has been recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal defense responses. The Arabidopsis CYP81F2 gene encodes a P450 monooxygenase that is essential for the pathogen-induced accumulation of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, which in turn is activated by the atypical PEN2 myrosinase (a type of beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) for antifungal defense. We propose that reiterated enzymatic cycles, controlling the generation of toxic molecules and their detoxification, enable the recruitment of glucosinolates in defense responses.<p>

Macrophages from C2D transgenic mice deficient in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins were used to identify binding sites for superantigens distinct from the MHC class II molecule. Iodinated staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B (SEA and SEB) and exfoliative toxins A and B (ETA and ETB) bound to C2D macrophages in a concentration-dependent and competitive manner. All four toxins increased F-actin concentration within 30 s of their addition to C2D macrophages, indicating that signal transduction occurred in response to toxin in the absence of class II MHC. Furthermore, ETA, ETB, SEA, and, to a lesser extent, SEB induced C2D macrophages to produce interleukin 6. Several molecular species on C2D macrophages with molecular masses of 140, 97, 61, 52, 43, and 37 kDa bound SEA in immunoprecipitation experiments. These data indicate the presence of novel, functionally active toxin binding sites on murine macrophages distinct from MHC class II molecules.<p>

The purpose of the study was to investigate molecular changes associated with glioma tissues using FT-IR microspectroscopic imaging (FT-IRM). A multivariate statistical analysis allowed one to successfully discriminate between normal, tumoral, peri-tumoral, and necrotic tissue structures. Structural changes were mainly related to qualitative and quantitative changes in lipid content, proteins, and nucleic acids that can be used as spectroscopic markers for this pathology. We have developed a spectroscopic model of glioma to quantify these chemical changes. The model constructed includes individual FT-IR spectra of normal and glioma brain constituents such as lipids, DNA, and proteins (measured on delipidized tissue). Modeling of FT-IR spectra yielded fit coefficients reflecting the chemical changes associated with a tumor. Our results demonstrate the ability of FT-IRM to assess the importance and distribution of each individual constituent and its variation in normal brain structures as well as in the different pathological states of glioma. We demonstrated that (i) cholesterol and phosphatidylethanolamine contributions are highest in corpus callosum and anterior commissure but decrease gradually towards the cortex surface as well as in the tumor, (ii) phosphatidylcholine contribution is highest in the cortex and decreases in the tumor, (iii) galactocerebroside is localized only in white, but not in gray matter, and decreases in the vital tumor region while the necrosis area shows a higher concentration of this cerebroside, (iv) DNA and oleic acid increase in the tumor as compared to gray matter. This approach could, in the future, contribute to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve the grading, prognosis, and play a vital role in therapeutic strategy and monitoring.<p>

Dorsoventral axis formation in the Drosophila embryo is established by a signal transduction pathway that comprises the products of at least 12 maternal genes. Two of these genes, dorsal and cactus, show homology to the mammalian transcription factor NF-kappa B and its inhibitor I kappa B, respectively. As in the case for I kappa B and NF-kappa B, Cactus inhibits Dorsal by retaining it in the cytoplasm. In response to the signal produced and transmitted by the products of the other genes, Dorsal translocates to the nucleus preferentially on the ventral side of the embryo. Here, we show that Cactus forms a cytoplasmic concentration gradient inversely correlated to the nuclear translocation gradient of Dorsal. Deletions of the N-terminus and C-terminus of Cactus reveal that two modes of degradation control cactus activity: signal-induced degradation and signal-independent degradation, respectively. Genetic evidence indicates that degradation of Cactus is required, but not sufficient to translocates Dorsal completely into the nucleus.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Depressive disorders are of great medical and political significance. Although evidence-based guidelines have been published and educational initiatives have been launched to implement them, they are rarely actually used. The aim of the study was to implement clinical practice guidelines for outpatient care of depression using a practice-oriented and interdisciplinary approach. DESIGN: Controlled clinical trial with a naturalistic design (data collection within routine practice) designed as a prospective pre-post study. SETTING: Outpatient care. PARTICIPANTS: 29 general practitioners (intervention: 18; control: 11) and 15 psychiatrists (intervention: 11; control: 4). Overall, the treatment of 698 patients (two samples: pre: 361; post: 337) was documented. INTERVENTION: s) Multifaceted intervention combining benchmarking, continuous medical education and interdisciplinary quality circles for the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mixed-effects regression models for cluster-adjusted analysis of patients' symptom reduction. RESULTS: Although physicians in the intervention group improved their clinical effectiveness (proportion of patients with response/remission) to a greater extent than physicians in the control group (intervention: 48.6% to 66.9%; control: 54.9% to 61.5%), cluster-adjusted analysis failed to prove a statistically significant effect of the intervention on the treatment outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistically significant improvements were found regarding the outcomes, the action programme provides important work, materials and results for an integrated treatment model for depression.<p>

Here, we show that FoxO3A transcription factor is upregulated upon calpain small-1 (CAPNS1) depletion both in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7. On starvation, CAPNS1 depletion is associated with a higher rate of FoxO3A dephosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus and to a sharper increase in the levels of p27Kip1 and Bim, the products of two FoxO target genes. Notably, FoxO3A depletion in CAPNS1-/- MEFs reduces both the induction of Bim and apoptosis. Both okadaic acid treatment and silencing of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit can partially reduce starvation-induced FoxO3A activation and apoptosis in CAPNS1-/- fibroblasts. PP2A associates more tightly with Akt in CAPNS1 knockout cells, indicating that PP2A is involved in calpain-mediated FoxO regulation. Finally, we show that PP2A regulatory subunits B56 alpha and gamma are in vitro substrates of calpain, and calpain regulates B56 alpha stability in vivo, suggesting a direct role of calpain in the regulation of PP2A function. In conclusion, for the first time we report that CAPNS1 interferes with PP2A-Akt interaction consequently affecting FoxO3A-dependent cell death. Calpain inhibition might therefore be exploited as a tool to induce apoptosis in tumors sensitive to FoxO activation.<p>

In fertilized fish eggs, lipids are an energy reservoir for the embryo development and substrate for organogenesis. They occur in the cytoplasmic area and form lipid droplets (LDs), but also the yolk egg is composed of lipids and proteins. Insight on the LD formation and distribution and their interactions with other cellular organelles could provide information about the role based on the egg development. For non-destructive, macro-scale visualization of biochemical components of fish eggs, such as lipids proteins and water, near-infrared (NIR) imaging is the method of choice. Mid-infrared (MIR) and Raman spectroscopy imaging were used to provide details on chemical composition of LDs and other egg organelles. NIR imaging illustrated main compartments of the egg including membrane, LDs, yolk, relative protein, and lipid content in well-localized egg structures and their interactions with water molecules. In the yolk, a co-existence of lipids and proteins with carotenoids and carbohydrates was detected by Raman spectroscopy. Results showed a prominent decrease of unsaturated fatty acids, phospholipids, and triglycerides/cholesteryl esters content in the eggs due to the embryo development. An opposite trend of changes was observed by MIR spectroscopy for the glycogen, suggesting that consumption of lipids occurred with production of this carbohydrate. The comprehensive vibrational spectroscopic analysis based on NIR, MIR, and Raman imaging is a unique tool in studying in situ dynamic biological processes.<p>

The persistent nature of addiction has been associated with activity-induced plasticity of neurons within the striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc). To identify the molecular processes leading to these adaptations, we performed Cre/loxP-mediated genetic ablations of two key regulators of gene expression in response to activity, the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) and its postulated main target, the cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB). We found that acute cocaine-induced gene expression in the striatum was largely unaffected by the loss of CaMKIV. On the behavioral level, mice lacking CaMKIV in dopaminoceptive neurons displayed increased sensitivity to cocaine as evidenced by augmented expression of locomotor sensitization and enhanced conditioned place preference and reinstatement after extinction. However, the loss of CREB in the forebrain had no effect on either of these behaviors, even though it robustly blunted acute cocaine-induced transcription. To test the relevance of these observations for addiction in humans, we performed an association study of CAMK4 and CREB promoter polymorphisms with cocaine addiction in a large sample of addicts. We found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in the CAMK4 promoter was significantly associated with cocaine addiction, whereas variations in the CREB promoter regions did not correlate with drug abuse. These findings reveal a critical role for CaMKIV in the development and persistence of cocaine-induced behaviors, through mechanisms dissociated from acute effects on gene expression and CREB-dependent transcription.<p>

We report a case of cervical necrotizing fasciitis (NF) with severe sepsis occurring 8 hours after a banal dental extraction in a healthy adult. A 44-year-old man was admitted for cervical NF and severe sepsis in the emergency department. An early diagnosis was based on clinical examination (violent pain, swelling of face, and crepitation), confirmed by computed tomography scan, which showed subcutaneous gas and a fracture of the maxillary sinus in regard of the extracted tooth. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy was started quickly followed by surgical debridement. Operative and sinus pus cultures were positive for polymicrobial strains (aerobes and anaerobe). Ventilatory and hemodynamic supports (large fluid infusion and catecholamine) were mandatory during a week. Successful outcome occurred within 2 weeks. Cervical NF is a rare but life-threatening disease with fulminant course. The mortality rate is high if the diagnosis and treatment are not begun promptly and vigorously. Therefore, the emergency medicine community must be aware of its initial symptoms.<p>

BACKGROUND: Surgery is the standard in the management of vulvar cancer. Several studies assessed the feasibility of radiochemotherapy as definitive therapy and/or neoadjuvant procedure in order to limit the extent of surgery. Combined radiochemotherapy is associated with considerable toxicity. The authors report on a modified neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy schedule which is isoeffective to the GOG (Gynecologic Oncology Group) protocol, but associated with less therapy-related toxicity. CASE REPORT: A 36-year-old woman with stage IV vulvar cancer and long-distance rectal infiltration is reported. Laparoscopic pretherapeutic staging confirmed pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases. RESULT: The patient received a neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. After complete remission, a simple vulvectomy carried out 3 months later showed no evidence of tumor. Up to now, there is no evidence of tumor progression or recurrence. CONCLUSION: Preoperative conventionally fractionated simultaneous radiochemotherapy seems to be a feasible and safe treatment option for patients with locally advanced vulvar cancer in order to avoid exenterative surgery.<p>

In an effort to select and characterize apple rootstock resistant to apple proliferation (AP), progenies from seven apomictic rootstock selections and their parental apomictic species, Malus sieboldii and M. sargentii, were compared to standard stocks M 9 and M 11. Seedlings derived from open pollinated mother plants were grafted with cv. Golden Delicious and grown under natural infection conditions. The progenies differed greatly in resistance to the AP agent 'Candidatus Phytoplasma mali'. Progenies of M. sieboldii and its descendent rootstock selections D2212, 4608, 4551, and D1131 showed a high level of resistance, whereas progenies of M. sargentii and its descendent selections D1111 and C1828 proved susceptible. M 9 and M 11 showed an intermediate level of resistance. Phytoplasma titer in roots of the M. sieboldii and M. sargentii progeny groups was similarly low, whereas the concentration in the standard stocks was 100 to 5,000 times higher. In trees on most of the resistant stocks, only a minority was colonized in the scion, while in trees on susceptible and standard stocks, infection rate was often higher. Also, the titer in the top of trees on resistant stocks was usually lower than in trees on susceptible and standard stocks. Four progenies derived from open pollinated M. sieboldii and M. sieboldii descendents were subjected to DNA typing using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. This study revealed that the selected groups consisted mainly of mother-like plants (apomicts) and type I hybrids (unreduced mother genotype plus one male allele at each locus). Type II hybrids (full recombinants) and autopollinated offspring were rare. In the 4608 progeny, trees grown on type I hybrid rootstocks were significantly less affected than trees on mother-like stocks. In other progenies with fewer or no type I hybrids, trees on type II hybrids and autopollinated offspring suffered considerably more from disease than trees on mother-like stocks.<p>

Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), and Dab1 are the main components of the Reelin signalling cascade. Reelin is the sole ligand defined so far in signalling through this pathway. Postnatal migration of neuronal precursors from the subventricular zone (SVZ) to the olfactory bulb (OB), however, depends on ApoER2 and Dab1, but functions independently of Reelin. Here, we show that thrombospondin-1 (THBS-1) is a novel physiological ligand for ApoER2 and VLDLR. THBS-1 is present in the SVZ and along the entire rostral migratory stream (RMS). It binds to ApoER2 and VLDLR and induces phosphorylation of Dab1. In contrast to Reelin, it does not induce Dab1 degradation or Akt phosphorylation, but stabilizes neuronal precursor chains derived from subventricular explants. Lack of THBS-1 results in anatomical abnormalities of the RMS and leads to a reduction of postnatal neuronal precursors entering the OB.<p>

Colic attacks by a foreign body in the urinary tract are very rare and mostly follow iatrogenic manipulation. This case report focuses on ureteric colic thought to result from radiological embolisation material. It is of practical interest because embolisation of prolonged bleeding after endourological procedures is widely done.An 80-year-old woman with a long history of nephrolithiasis underwent percutaneous nephrolithotomy. She suffered from a continuous, transfusion-obligatory bleeding. The source of bleeding was treated with embolisation by coiling. About 2 years later, the patient presented with persistent pain on the right abdominal side and urinary obstruction. A dislocation of the coils into the ureteropelvic junction was diagnosed. After primary ureteral stenting, the foreign body was removed via ureterotomy.<p>

BACKGROUND: We report a 31-year-old farmer whose work consists in handling cereal and vegetables, who consulted our clinic because of asthma symptoms after inhalation of dust during manipulation of the deposited material, usually inside the warehouse. METHODS AND RESULTS: Skin prick tests and specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) determinations were negative with common aeroallergens. The patient noted the presence of many spiders in the warehouse, which were identified as the cellar spider Holocnemus pluchei and the common house spider, Tegenaria domestica. Extracts of spider bodies brought in by the patient were obtained and used to perform in vivo and in vitro studies. Molecular characterization of IgE-binding bands was performed by mass spectrometry. We obtained positive prick tests to the extracts of the bodies of both spiders. Immunoblotting displayed different bands in both spider extracts, in a range of 20-70 kDa. All were hemocyanins, except for a 17-kDa protein of Holocnemus identified as an arginine kinase (AK). Bronchial challenge was positive with the extract of the cellar spider and with the AK, but was negative with the domestic house spider. CONCLUSION: We present the first case of respiratory allergy due to sensitization to AK from a common spider, confirmed by bronchial provocation tests.<p>

OBJECTIVE: We used an algorithm for quantitative image processing to classify breast tissue into the categories fibrosis, involution atrophy, and normal. The algorithm entailed use of Minkowski functionals in topologic analysis of x-ray attenuation patterns on digital mammograms. The results were compared with those of techniques based on evaluation of gray-level histograms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred digital mammograms were classified by consensus of two experienced readers. A topologic parameter extracted from the Minkowski functional spectra was obtained for retromammilar image sections (512 x 512 pixels). From the gray-level histogram of each of these samples, the 20th percentile, median, and mean were determined. Discriminant analysis was used to assess the predictive value of the methods with respect to correct categorization. RESULTS: The mean gray-level intensity of normal breast tissue was 90 +/- 9, and the 20th percentile was 68 +/- 18. The mean gray-level intensity was 84 +/- 7 for involution and 90 +/- 8 for fibrosis; the 20th percentile was 75 +/- 6 for involution and 73 +/- 10 for fibrosis. The results of discriminant analysis showed that use of the gray-level histogram parameters led to correct classification in 66% of cases. Use of topologic analysis with Minkowski functionals increased the rate of correct classification to 83%. When a combined model of histogram-derived parameters and Minkowski functionals was used, 89% of cases were categorized correctly. CONCLUSION: Topologic analysis of x-ray attenuation patterns on digital mammograms obtained with Minkowski functionals is simple and robust, and the results agree with radiologists' ratings. Because correct classification is significantly higher than with use of density features, our technique may be an objective and quantitative alternative in the evaluation of the parenchymal structure of the breast.<p>

Ovarian development and egg maturation are crucial processes for the success of reproduction in ticks. Three full-length cDNAs encoding the precursor of major yolk protein, vitellogenin, were obtained from cDNA libraries of the Haemaphysalis longicornis tick and designated as HlVg-1, HlVg-2 and HlVg-3. The HlVg mRNAs were found in fed females with major expression sites in the midgut, fat body and ovary. Native PAGE and Western blot demonstrated that HlVgs in the hemolymph, fat body and ovary of fed females consisted of four major polypeptides. RNAi results showed that HlVg dsRNA-injected ticks obtained lower body weight, egg weight and showed higher mortality of engorged females after blood sucking than control groups. Our results indicate that all HlVgs are essential for egg development and oviposition.<p>

Direct numerical simulations of two-dimensional decaying MHD turbulence in bounded domains show the rapid generation of angular momentum in nonaxisymmetric geometries. It is found that magnetic fluctuations enhance this mechanism. On a larger time scale, the generation of a magnetic angular momentum, or angular field, is observed. For axisymmetric geometries, the generation of angular momentum is absent; nevertheless, a weak magnetic field can be observed. The derived evolution equations for both the angular momentum and angular field yield possible explanations for the observed behavior.<p>

An organic anion-transporting polypeptide that mediates sodium-independent uptake of negatively charged sulfobromophthalein and bile salts has recently been cloned from rat liver (Jacquemin et al., 1994). In this study we have extended the substrate specificity studies to neutral and positively charged organic compounds with use of the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression systems. We found that the same transporting polypeptide can also transport the neutral cardiac glycoside ouabain (apparent Km approximately 1.7mM); the endogenous steroids aldosterone (Km approximately 15nM), cortisol (Km approximately 13 microM) and dexamethasone; the anionic steroid-conjugates estrone-3-sulfate (Km approximately 4.5 microM) and estradiol-17-glucuronide (Km approximately 3.0 microM) and the exogenous amphipathic organic cation N-(4,4-azo-n-pentyl)-21-deoxyajmalinium, a permanently charged photolabile derivative of the antiarrhythmic drug N-propylajmaline. These data demonstrate that the previously cloned hepatic organic anion-transporting polypeptide can in fact transport a wide range of differently charged lipophilic organic compounds including exogenous and endogenous organic anions, neutral steroids and organic cations. Hence, a single sinusoidal (or basolateral) transporting polypeptide can account, at least in part, for charge-independent steroid and drug clearance in mammalian liver.<p>

56 patients with Bell's palsy were tested with electroneuronography (ENoG and Blink reflex (BR) within the 5th and 15th day of onset of facial paralysis. The recovery at the end of evolution was evaluated with the study of facial function. This retrospective study showed that ENoG is able to predict with a very low risk of error a good prognosis when more than 10 percent (strictly, of fibers (non degenerated and blocked) are active. On the other hand only persistence or early recovery of BR can assure a good prognosis whereas the absence do not permit to conclude.<p>

We conducted a prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded end point (PROBE) study examining the relative efficacy of irbesartan 300 mg/day versus maximising dose of ACE inhibitor, additional to background conventional heart failure therapy. Patients with CHF, NYHA Class II-III and a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40% were randomised to one of two treatment arms. All patients were receiving &lt;/= half target dose of ACE inhibitor as background therapy. 44 patients received an increase in their background ACE inhibitor while 45 patients were given irbesartan (target dose 300 mg/day) in addition to their background ACE inhibitor. The primary end-point was change in brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) from baseline to 6 months. Change in hs-CRP level, 6 min walk distance, and Minnesota living with heart failure quality of life questionnaire (MLWHF) from baseline to 6 months were also evaluated. Patients were well matched at baseline for all end-point parameters as well as for age, gender and baseline systolic ventricular function. There was general improvement in clinical status for all patients but no significant difference between increased ACE inhibitor vs added ARB for change in BNP, hs-CRP, NYHA, 6 min walk or MLWHF (all P&gt;0.05). This PROBE study has demonstrated similar clinical responses with increased dose of ACE inhibitor compared to addition of ARB in patients with systolic CHF. These findings suggest that either approach to increasing renin-angiotensin blockade in patients taking low doses of background ACE inhibitor results in similar clinical outcomes.<p>

Self-assembling peptide hydrogels are used to directly encapsulate and controllably release model FITC-dextran macromolecules of varying size and hydrodynamic diameters. MAX1 and MAX8 are two peptide sequences with different charge states that have been designed to intramolecularly fold and self assemble into hydrogels at physiological buffer conditions (pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl). When self-assembly is initiated in the presence of dextran or protein probes, these macromolecules are directly encapsulated in the gel. Self-diffusion studies using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and bulk release studies indicate that macromolecule mobility within, and release out of, these gels can be modulated by varying the hydrogel mesh size. The average mesh size can be modulated by simply varying the concentration of a given peptide used to construct the gel or by altering the peptide sequence. In addition, results suggest that electrostatic interactions between the macromolecules and the peptide network influence mobility and release. Depending on probe size, release half-lives can be varied from 8h to over a month.<p>

A growing number of medications must be administered through parenteral delivery, i.e., intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection, to ensure effectiveness of the therapeutic. For some therapeutics, the use of delivery vehicles in conjunction with this delivery mechanism can improve drug efficacy and patient compliance. Macromolecular self-assembly has been exploited recently to engineer materials for the encapsulation and controlled delivery of therapeutics. Self-assembled materials offer the advantages of conventional crosslinked materials normally used for release, but also provide the ability to tailor specific bulk material properties, such as release profiles, at the molecular level via monomer design. As a result, the design of materials from the &quot;bottom up&quot; approach has generated a variety of supramolecular devices for biomedical applications. This review provides an overview of self-assembling molecules, their resultant structures, and their use in therapeutic delivery. It highlights the current progress in the design of polymer- and peptide-based self-assembled materials.<p>

The factors determining glycosylation of mucin type glycoproteins are not well understood. In the present work, we investigated the role of the peptide moiety and of the presence of O-glycan chains on O-glycosylation by UDP-GalNAc: polypeptide alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase (ppGalNAc-T). We used purified ppGalNAc-T from bovine colostrum and a series of synthetic glycopeptide and peptide substrates most of which contained sequences derived from the tandem repeat region of MUC2 mucin. The rate of incorporation of GalNAc into Thr was significantly greater than toward Ser residues. The presence of one or two GalNAc-Thr moieties in the substrate significantly reduced enzyme activity, and this effect was more pronounced when the disaccharide Gal beta 1-3GalNAc was present. Thus the sequential attachment of a second GalNAc residue in the vicinity of a pre-existing GalNAc-Thr or Gal beta 1-3GalNAc-Thr occurs at a slower rate than primary glycosylation of carbohydrate-free peptide. Analysis of products by HPLC showed that the enzyme was selective in glycosylating peptides or glycopeptides with the PTTTPIST sequence in that the preferred primary glycosylation site was the third Thr from the amino-terminal end; secondary glycosylation depended on the site of the primary glycosylation. Negatively but not positively charged amino acids on the carboxy-terminal side of the putative secondary glycosylation site resulted in high activity suggesting charge-charge interactions of substrates with the enzyme. These studies indicate that O-glycosylation by bovine colostrum ppGalNAc-T is a selective process dependent on both the amino acid sequence and prior glycosylation of peptide substrates.<p>

UNLABELLED: This study evaluated the ability of end-of-day (EOD) ratings to accurately reflect momentary (EMA) ratings on 10 widely used pain and fatigue items. Rheumatology patients (n = 105) completed &gt;or=5 randomly scheduled EMA assessments of each item per day as well as EOD ratings. Correlations were high between EOD and EMA ratings of the 5 pain items (r = .90 to .92) and somewhat lower for the 5 fatigue/energy items (r = .71 to .86). To examine the ability of EOD ratings to represent 1 week of EMA ratings, 7 EOD ratings were averaged and correlated with EMA (r &gt;or= .95 for pain items, r = .88 to .95 for fatigue/energy items). Further, averaging only 3 to 5 EOD ratings achieved very high correlations with 1 week of EMA ratings. Within-subject correlations of EOD with mean daily EMA across 7 days confirmed patients' ability to provide daily ratings that accurately reflect their day-to-day variation in symptom levels. These EOD results were compared to traditional recall ratings collected in the same protocol. It was concluded (1) that EOD ratings were a better representation of EMA than were recall ratings, and (2) that EOD ratings across a reporting period can replace EMA for studies targeting average levels of pain or fatigue. PERSPECTIVE: This study in chronic pain patients demonstrated that end-of-day ratings of pain are highly accurate representations of average levels of pain experience across a day; ratings of fatigue were somewhat less accurate, though still at a level that would be valid.<p>

Total lipid content, lipid classes and fatty acid composition were analysed in tissues from two eelpout species fed on the same diet, the Antarctic Pachycara brachycephalum and the temperate Zoarces viviparus, with the aim of determining the role of lipids in fishes from different thermal habitats. The lipid content increased with decreasing temperature in the liver of both species, suggesting enhanced lipid storage under cold conditions. In P. brachycephalum, lipid composition in the liver and muscle was strongly dominated by triacylglycerols between 0 and 6 degrees C. In contrast, in the temperate species, lipid class composition changed with changes in the temperature. When acclimatized to 4 and 6 degrees C Z. viviparus not only displayed a shift to lipid anabolism and pronounced lipid storage, as indicated by high triacylglycerol levels, but also a shift to patterns of cold adaptation, as reflected by an increased content of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the lipid extract. Unsaturated fatty acids were also abundant in the Antarctic eelpout, but when compared to Z. viviparus at the same temperatures, the latter had significantly higher ratios of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acid levels, whereas the Antarctic eelpout showed significantly higher ratios of monounsaturated to saturated fatty acid levels. High delta-15N values of the Antarctic eelpout reflect the high trophic level of this scavenger in the Weddell Sea food web. Stable carbon values suggest that lipid-enriched prey forms a major part of its diet. The strategy to accumulate storage lipids in the cold is interpreted to be adaptive behaviour at colder temperatures and during periods of irregular, pulsed food supply.<p>

OBJECTIVES: To describe a surgical approach for the removal of nonarticular base sesamoid fragments in performance horses and to report the outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Horses (n=11), 7 months to 10 years of age, with lameness because of nonarticular base sesamoid fragments. METHODS: Lameness was localized to the metacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal region by clinical examination or response to diagnostic local anesthesia. Radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of a nonarticular base sesamoid fragment. Surgical removal was performed with an incision over the base of the affected sesamoid through the digital flexor tendon sheath. After identifying the fragment with the aid of needles, a small vertical incision was made in the straight distal sesamoidean ligament (SDSL) and the fragment was freed from its attachments and removed. Six months convalescence and rehabilitation was prescribed for all horses. RESULTS: Eleven horses had 16 nonarticular fragments of the base of the proximal sesamoid bones. Eleven (69%) fragments occurred in the forelimbs with the right front (82%) and medial sesamoid (73%) more commonly affected. Horses were treated by surgical fragment removal. In horses with follow-up, 9 of 10 returned to their intended use. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical removal of nonarticular base sesamoid fragments can be accomplished through a palmar/plantar approach through the digital flexor tendon sheath and SDSL. This &quot;keyhole&quot; approach minimizes damage to the distal sesamoidean ligament attachments to the sesamoid base and allows some horses to return to their intended use. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Surgical removal of nonarticular base sesamoid fragments should be considered in horses with performance-limiting lameness as a result of the fragment.<p>

Bronstein, P. A., et al. (2008). &quot;Global transcriptional responses of Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 to changes in iron bioavailability in vitro.&quot; <u>BMC Microbiology</u> <b>8</b>: 209.<p>
BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (DC3000) is a Gram-negative model plant pathogen that is found in a wide variety of environments. To survive in these diverse conditions it must sense and respond to various environmental cues. One micronutrient required for most forms of life is iron. Bioavailable iron has been shown to be an important global regulator for many bacteria where it not only regulates a wide variety of genes involved in general cell physiology but also virulence determinants. In this study we used microarrays to study differential gene regulation in DC3000 in response to changes in levels of cell-associated iron. RESULTS: DC3000 cultures were grown under highly controlled conditions and analyzed after the addition of iron citrate or sodium citrate to the media. In the cultures supplemented with iron, we found that cell-associated iron increased rapidly while culture densities were not significantly different over 4 hours when compared to cultures with sodium citrate added. Microarray analysis of samples taken from before and after the addition of either sodium citrate or iron citrate identified 386 differentially regulated genes with high statistical confidence. Differentially regulated genes were clustered based on expression patterns observed between comparison of samples taken at different time points and with different supplements. This analysis grouped genes associated with the same regulatory motifs and/or had similar putative or known function. CONCLUSION: This study shows iron is rapidly taken up from the medium by iron-depleted DC3000 cultures and that bioavailable iron is a global cue for the expression of iron transport, storage, and known virulence factors in DC3000. Furthermore approximately 34% of the differentially regulated genes are associated with one of four regulatory motifs for Fur, PvdS, HrpL, or RpoD.<p>

The isolation and characterization of homogeneous arginine kinase from the cockroach is reported. The purification protocol produces 6.6 mg of pure enzyme from 6.8 g of whole cockroach. The purified enzyme cross-reacts with a heterologous antibody and monoclonal antibody against arginine kinase from the shrimp. Both antibody preparations also cross-react with extracts from several species known to contain monomeric arginine kinase, but fail to react with extracts from organisms containing dimeric arginine kinase. Cockroach arginine kinase has a molecular mass of approximately 43,000 determined from measurements by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis. Compared with other arginine kinases, the enzyme from the cockroach is relatively thermostable (50% activity retained at 50 degrees C for 10 min) and has a pH optima of 8.5 and 6.5-7.5, for the forward and reverse reactions, respectively. Treatment with 5,5'dithiobis[2-nitrobenzoic acid] indicates that arginine kinase has a single reactive sulfhydryl group and, interestingly, the reaction is biphasic. The Michaelis constants for the phosphagen substrates, arginine: 0.49 mM, phosphoarginine: 0.94 mM, and nucleotide substrates MgATP: 0.14 mM, MgADP: 0.09 mM, are in the range reported for other arginine kinases. A 1% solution of pure enzyme has an absorbance of 7.0 at 280 nm. Calculations based on circular dichroic spectra indicate that arginine kinase from the cockroach has 12% alpha-helical structure. The intrinsic protein fluorescence emission maximum at 340 nm suggests that tryptophan residues are below the surface of the protein and not exposed to solvent. Arginine kinase from the cockroach and shrimp are known to be deleterious immunogens towards humans. The availability of pure protein, its characterization and potential regulation of activity, will be useful in developing agents to control the cockroach population and its destructive role in agriculture and human health.<p>

The kinetic mechanism and evaluation of several potential inhibitors of purified arginine kinase from the cockroach (Periplanta americana) were investigated. This monomeric phosphagen kinase is important in maintaining ATP levels during the rapid energy demands of muscle required for contraction and motility. Analysis reveals the following dissociation constants (mM) for the binary complex: E.Arg P--&gt;E+Arg P, K=1.0; E.Arg--&gt;E+Arg, K=0.45; E.MgATP--&gt;E+MgATP, K=0.17; E.MgADP--&gt;E+MgADP, K=0.12; and the ternary complex: Arg P.E.MgADP--&gt;E.MgADP+Arg P, K=0.94; Arg.E.MgATP--&gt;E.MgATP+Arg, K=0.49; MgATP.Enz.Arg--&gt;E.Arg+MgATP, K=0.14; MgADP.E.Arg P--&gt;E.Arg P+MgADP, K=0.09. For a particular substrate, the ratio of the dissociation constants for the binary to ternary complex is close to one, indicating little, if any, cooperativity in substrate binding for the rapid equilibrium, random addition mechanism. The time course of the arginine kinase reaction exhibits a pronounced curvature, which, as described for enzyme from other sources, is attributed to formation of an inhibitory catalytic dead-end complex, MgADP.E.Arg. The curvature is accentuated by the addition of monovalent anions, including borate, thiocyanate, and, most notably, nitrite and nitrate. This effect is attributed to stabilization of the dead-end complex through formation of a transition state analog. However, the substantial decrease in initial velocity (92%) caused by nitrate is due to an additional inhibitory effect, further characterized as non-competitive inhibition (Ki=8.0 mM) with the substrate L-arginine. On the other hand, borate inhibition of the initial velocity is only 30% with significant subsequent curvature, suggesting that this anion functions as an inhibitor mainly by formation of a transition state analog. However, some component of the borate inhibition appears to be mediated by an apparent partial competitive inhibition with L-arginine. D-arginine is not a substrate for arginine kinase from the cockroach, but is an effective competitive inhibitor with a Ki=0.31 mM. L-Canavanine is a weak substrate for arginine kinase (Km=6.7 mM) with a Vmax for the pure enzyme that is approximately one-third that of L-arginine. However, initial velocity experiments of substrate mixtures suggest that competition between L-canavanine and L-arginine may not be a simple summation effect and may involve a structural modification. Sensitivity of arginine kinase activity to D-arginine as well as nitrate and borate anions, coupled with the fact that L-arginine is an essential amino acid for the cockroach, suggest that arginine kinase could be a useful chemotherapeutic target for the control of cockroach proliferation.<p>

The issue of whether a high carbohydrate intake affects sleepiness and sleep variables has been studied in normals but not in patients suffering from narcolepsy, despite anecdotal evidence that sugars may facilitate sleepiness in this population. This study investigated whether the intake of 50 g glucose exacerbated sleepiness in narcolepsy subjects. A double-blind cross-over study, involving 12 narcolepsy subjects and 12 matched controls, measured behaviour after a light lunch supplemented with a drink of either 50 g glucose or placebo (artificially sweetened drink). The main dependent variables were the performance and EEG measures from the Wilkinson Auditory Vigilance Task (WAVT) and sleep variables from a 45 minute nap. The results indicate that in the narcolepsy subjects glucose was associated with decreased wake duration, reduced sleep onset latency and more spontaneous and induced sleep stage changes during the WAVT, while the nap revealed an increased intensity of sleepiness after glucose as measured by the Polygraphic Score of Sleepiness. Eleven of the twelve narcolepsy subjects showed increased REM duration in the nap after glucose. The findings are discussed in relation to serotonin synthesis, basal sleepiness and possible irregularities in the action of insulin.<p>

Density functional theory was employed to study the dependence of 13C and 15N magnetic shielding tensors on the glycosidic torsion angle (chi) and conformation of the sugar ring in 2'-deoxyadenosine, 2'-deoxyguanosine, 2'-deoxycytidine, and 2'-deoxythymidine. In general, the magnetic shielding of the glycosidic nitrogens and the sugar carbons was found to depend on both the conformation of the sugar ring and chi. Our calculations indicate that the magnetic shielding anisotropy of the C6 atom in pyrimidine and the C8 atom in purine bases depends strongly on chi. The remaining base carbons were found to be insensitive to both sugar pucker and chi re-orientation. These results call into question the underlying assumptions of currently established methods for interpreting residual chemical shift anisotropies and 13C and 15N auto- and cross-correlated relaxation rates and highlight possible limitations of DNA applications of these methods.<p>

Broadband THz pulses have been generated in 2-[3-(4- hydroxystyryl)-5,5-dimethylcyclohex-2-enylidene]malononitrile (OH1) by optical rectification of sub-picosecond laser pulses. We show that OH1 crystals allow velocity-matched generation and detection of THz frequencies in the whole range between 0.3 and 2.5 THz for a pump laser wavelength range from 1200 to 1460 nm. OH1 crystals show a higher figure of merit for THz generation and detection in the optimized range compared to the benchmark inorganic semiconductor crystals ZnTe and GaAs and the organic ionic salt crystal 4-N,N-dimethylamino-4'-N'-methyl stilbazolium tosylate (DAST). The material shows a low THz absorption coefficient alpha3 in the range between 0.3 and 2.5 THz, reaching values lower than 0.2mm(-1) between 0.7 and 1.0 THz. This is similar as in ZnTe and GaAs, but much lower than in DAST in the respective optimum frequency range. A peak THz electric field of 100 kV/cm and a photon conversion efficiency of 11 percent have been achieved at a pump pulse energy of 45 microJ.<p>

Nearly all of the services offered through managed behavioral health care companies are brief or time effective in nature. It is often the view of these companies that many of their providers have insufficient backgrounds in doing such treatment and have been trained in longer, less efficient modes of service delivery. Although this is often the case, what is frequently not recognized is that most managed behavioral health care companies themselves lack knowledge and clarity about such therapies. We address the critical need for behavioral health care companies to become learning organizations focused on research and development and internal as well as external training in time-efficient therapies. Such activities will allow for creativity and enhancement of the substance abuse and mental health care areas.<p>

The resulting data were used to quantify the effects on human dynamic response of varying helmet mass and seat acceleration as well as to provide comparisons to previously established safe limits of impact exposures. Tests with human subjects and a 97th percentile manikin were performed at seat impact levels of up to + 10 Gz for human and + 15 Gz for manikins, with standard and prototype helmet-mounted systems weighing from 3.2 to 6.6 lb. The results showed that increases in the helmet weight and seat acceleration resulted in increased compression, shear, and rotational forces on the neck. With helmet weights greater than 4.5 lb during +15 Gz impacts, neck compression force began to exceed established cadaver injury limits.<p>

Arthropod hemocyanins are large, multimeric, (n x 6) copper-containing proteins that deliver oxygen in the haemolymph of many chelicerate, crustacean, myriapod, and also possibly some insect species. The arthropod hemocyanins belong to a large protein superfamily that also includes the arthropod phenoloxidases, certain crustacean and insect storage proteins (pseudo-hemocyanins and hexamerins), and the insect hexamerin receptors. Here I summarise the present knowledge of the origin, functional adaptations, and evolution of these proteins. Arthropod and mollusc hemocyanins are, if at all, only distantly related. As early as in the arthropod stem line, the hemocyanins emerged from a phenoloxidase-like enzyme. The evolution of distinct hemocyanin subunits, as well as the formation of multi-hexamers occurred independently within the arthropod subphyla. Hemocyanin subunit evolution is strikingly different in the Chelicerata, Myriapoda and Crustacea. Hemocyanins individually gave rise to two distinct copper-less storage proteins, the insect hexamerins and the crustacean pseudo-hemocyanins (cryptocyanins). The receptor responsible for the uptake of hexamerin by the larval fat body of the insects emerged from a hexamerin-precursor. Molecular phylogenetic analyses show a close relationship of the crustacean and insect proteins, providing strong support for a pancrustacean taxon, while structural data suggest a myriapod-chelicerate clade.<p>

Dipteran arylphorin receptors, insect hexamerins, cheliceratan and crustacean hemocyanins, and crustacean and insect tyrosinases display significant sequence similarities. We have undertaken a systematic comparison of primary and secondary structures of these proteins. On the basis of multiple sequence alignments the phylogeny of these proteins was investigated. Hexamerin subunits, hemocyanin subunits, and tyrosinases share extensive similarities throughout the entire amino acid sequence. Our studies suggest the origin of arthropod hemocyanins from ancient tyrosinase-like proteins. Insect hexamerins likely evolved from hemocyanins of ancient crustaceans, supporting the proposed sister-group position of these subphyla. Arylphorin receptors, responsible for incorporation of hexamerins into the larval fat body of diptera, are related to hexamerins, hemocyanins, and tyrosinase. The receptor sequences display extensive similarities to the first and third domains of hemocyanins and hexamerins. In the middle region only limited amino acid conservation was observed. Elements important for hexamer formation are deleted in the receptors. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that dipteran arylphorin receptors diverged from ancient hexamerins, probably early in insect evolution.<p>

OBJECTIVE: The study compared services received in substance abuse treatment programs by women who reported involvement in prostitution and by those who did not. METHODS: Women (N=1,604) in a national study of substance abuse programs completed a structured interview assessing substance abuse, demographic characteristics, and past-year prostitution at program entry. At discharge, information was gathered on treatment modality (residential including inpatient, or outpatient), duration, and amounts of medical, mental health, and psychosocial services received during treatment. Analyses compared women involved in prostitution and those not involved. RESULTS: Women involved in prostitution were more likely to enter residential treatment. No differences between involvement groups were found in residential treatment duration, services received in residential treatment, or length of outpatient enrollment. In outpatient programs, women involved in prostitution received more psychosocial services. CONCLUSIONS: Substance abuse treatment programs appear responsive to the greater needs of women involved in prostitution. However, more research is needed on outcomes.<p>

Methods were developed for the purification, at high yield, of four different particle types of African horsesickness virus serotype 9 (AHSV-9). These products included virus particles purified on CsCl gradients which contain proteins apparently directly comparable to those of bluetongue virus (VP1 to VP7); virus particles purified on sucrose gradients which also contain, as a variable component, protein NS2; infectious subviral particles (ISVPs), containing chymotrypsin cleavage products of VP2; and cores, obtained by treating purified ISVPs with 1 M-MgCl2 to remove the components of the outer capsid layer (VP5 and VP2 cleavage products). Additional protein bands migrating with apparent M(r)s lower than that of VP5 were detected during SDS-PAGE analysis of virus particles. These appear to be conformational variants of VP5 and are identified as VP5' and VP5&quot;. BHK-21 cells infected with this strain of AHSV-9 produce large quantities of flat, usually hexagonal crystals of VP7, a major group antigen and core protein; these were also purified. Either 20 mg of virus particles, 20 mg of ISVPs or 10 mg of cores as well as 20 mg of VP7 crystals could be purified from approximately 8 x 10(9) infected cells. None of the preparations of particles or crystals showed any detectable contamination with BHK-21 cell proteins or antigens, as determined by SDS-PAGE or indirect ELISA. Virus particle and ISVP preparations had similar specific infectivities for BHK-21 cells (approximately 1 x 10(9) TCID50/A260 unit) but the infectivity of cores was approximately 10(5)-fold lower.<p>

Terrestrial animals including the human require regular periodic gravitational (g) stimulation to maintain normal physiologic functions on earth or in space. Identical g stimulations can be produced in space with inertial forces (G) using a centrifuge. These stimulations may be made more efficient in preventing physiologic deconditioning by increasing G levels above 1 G. The effective operational use of the centrifuge in space to prevent physiologic deconditioning from microgravity exposures will require ground-based studies using weightless simulation such as bedrest or dry immersion with laboratories that have human-use centrifuges. The use of periodic, increased-G exposures in space may offer a practical inexpensive solution in preventing physiologic deconditioning.<p>

The current level of palliative care in Germany is unsatisfactory. Health care professionals view the psychosocial support of patients and families and the collaboration amongst the different care providers as the main deficiencies. In this context little is known about the viewpoints of community pastors who might have an important role in providing psychosocial and spiritual care for patients at home. In order to study their perspectives we performed 76 standardized telephone interviews with Protestant and Catholic pastors and examined how much contact pastors had with palliative care patients; their views of the collaboration with health care professionals; and how the pastors assessed their own skills in palliative care. Forty-one percent of respondents had no contact with any palliative care patients. The majority perceived collaboration with family doctors to be insufficient. The pastors assessed their own skills concerning palliative care predominantly as &quot;satisfactory&quot;. Our findings suggest that community pastors' participation in the delivery of palliative care in Germany might be encouraged by specialized training and intensified contact with health care professionals.<p>

It is well established in the literature that circulating high levels of juvenile hormone (JH) are responsible for the initiation of vitellogenesis and female reproduction in most insects studied so far. Exceptions include some Diptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. The current view is that JH also regulates yolk protein (vitellogenin, Vg) synthesis and female reproduction in mites. However, there is no published evidence that mites have the common insect JHs at any stage of their development. Also, research on the effects of exogenous applications of JH and JH analogs on the reproduction of mites is contradictory. Significant information is available on the life history of mite reproduction, and new information has become available on mite storage proteins including Vg. Although initial studies suggested that ticks may respond to exogenously applied juvenile hormone or anti-JHs, current research shows that ticks cannot synthesize the common insect JHs and have no detectable levels of these hormones in their hemolymph during female reproduction. In ticks, it appears that ecdysteroids, and not JH, regulate expression of the Vg gene and the synthesis and release of Vg protein into the hemolymph. In fact within the Arthropoda, JH has been found only in insects. Methyl farnesoate and not JH regulates Vg synthesis in the Crustacea, the sister group to the insects. Based on this evidence, a new working hypothesis is proposed, i.e., that ecdysteroids and not the JHs regulate vitellogenesis in the Acari including both ticks and mites. To the present, the role of neuropeptides in the regulation of female reproduction in mites is not known.<p>

Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite-primed polymerase chain reaction (MP-PCR) were used to characterize 164 isolates of Cercospora kikuchii, most of which were collected from Louisiana. Plant tissue (seeds versus leaves), but not host cultivar, had a significant impact on pathogen population differentiation. Cluster analysis showed that the Louisiana population was dominated by a primary lineage (group I) with only a few Louisiana isolates belonging to the minor lineage that also included the non-Louisiana isolates (group II). A previous study showed that isolates could be differentiated according to vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs). However, RAPD and MP-PCR data demonstrated that isolates of C. kikuchii were not generally clustered according to these VCGs. Furthermore, genetic relationships within and between VCGs were examined using sequences of the intergenic spacer region of rDNA. These analyses showed that VCG is not an indicator of evolutionary lineage in this fungus. Our results suggest the likely existence of a cryptically functioning sexual stage in some portion of the C. kikuchii population.<p>

Strain UCD 311 is a transposon-induced mutant of Nostoc sp. strain ATC C 29133 that is unable to fix nitrogen in air but does so under anoxic conditions and is able to establish a functional symbiotic association with the hornwort Anthoceros punctatus. These properties of strain UCD 311 are consistent with previous observations that protection against oxygen inactivation of nitrogenase is physiologically provided within A. punctatus tissue. Upon deprivation of combined nitrogen, strain UCD 311 clearly differentiates heterocysts and contains typical heterocyst-specific glycolipids; it also makes apparently normal akinetes upon phosphate starvation. Sequence analysis adjacent to the point of the transposon insertion revealed an open reading frame designated devR. Southern analysis established that similar sequences are present in other heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria. devR putatively encodes a protein of 135 amino acids with high similarity to the receiver domains of response regulator proteins characteristics of two-component regulatory systems. On the basis of its size and the absence of other functional domains, DevR is most similar to CheY and Spo0F. Reconstruction of the mutation with an interposon vector confirmed that the transposition event was responsible for the mutant phenotype. The presence of wild-type devR on a plasmid in strain UCD 311 restored the ability to fix nitrogen in air. While devR was not essential for differentiation of akinetes, its presence in trans in Nostoc sp. strain ATCC 29133 stimulated their formation to above normal levels in aging medium. On the basis of RNA analysis, devR is constitutively expressed with respect to the nitrogen source for growth. The devR gene product is essential to the development of mature heterocysts and may be involved in a sensory pathway that is not directly responsive to cellular nitrogen status.<p>

The present work evaluates the kinetics of utilization of the main potential energy sources throughout the embryonic developmental stages of Boophilus microplus. The embryonic development of this arthropod is completed in 21 days. Cellularization of the blastoderm occurs on the 6th day and is rapidly followed by germ band extension and segmentation, whose first signs are visible on the 7th day. Cellularization is typically a maternal-driven process, carried out by molecular determinants deposited in the oocyte during oogenesis. On the other hand, segmentation is of zygotic nature, being the consequence of the synthesis of various components by the growing embryo. The enhancement in total B. microplus RNA was observed after cellularization, corroborating the replacement of maternal-driven processes by embryonic zygotic expression. An abrupt increase in oxygen consumption was observed from cellularization until the 8th day of development. The reduction in dry weight at the same period and the susceptibility of oxygen consumption to KCN suggest that the respiration process is activated during early embryonic development. A marked decrease in total lipid content occurred between the 5th and 7th days of development, suggesting this is the main energy source for cellularization. A major reduction in carbohydrate content occurred later, between the 7th and 9th days, and it could be assigned to the morphological segmentation of the embryo. Although the total amount of proteins remains unchanged from oviposition to hatching, a 15% reduction in vitellin (VT) content was observed before cellularization, up to the 4th day after egglaying. This observation was correlated to the synthesis of new proteins needed to support early embryo development. Additional 20% of VT was consumed thereafter, mainly at the end of embryogenesis, and in this case VT is probably used as energy source to the older embryo. Altogether, these data indicate different energy sources for maternal and zygotic driven processes.<p>

Since the publication of the first paper on NOTES, a dramatic increase of activities in this new surgical field is to be observed. However, a &quot;pure&quot; NOTES operation does not yet exist. Only NOTES-like operations have been proposed so far. One of the essential barriers is the limited intraoperative performance due to the lack of suitable mechatronic platforms. Some solutions have already been suggested but they are still far from having any practical impact upon the development of more advanced NOTES procedures. The &quot;Highly Versatile Single Port System&quot;, a two-armed device with two manipulators and a semi-flexible telescope, was developed to overcome these drawbacks. A transsigmoid cholecystectomy on a NOTES simulator (the ELITE) could be accomplished successfully in 75 minutes. We could therefore show that the HVSPS is in principle applicable for such a NOTES procedure. However, before these mechatronic support systems can be used under clinical conditions, required human machine interface and extended intelligence have to be solved.<p>

This work analyzed the process of lipid storage in fat body of larval Manduca sexta, focusing on the role of lipid transfer particle (LTP). Incubation of fat bodies with [(3)H]diacylglycerol-labeled lipophorin resulted in a significant accumulation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) in the tissue. Transfer of DAG to fat body and its storage as TAG was significantly inhibited (60%) by preincubating the tissue with anti-LTP antibody. Lipid transfer was restored to control values by adding LTP to fat body. Incubation of fat body with dual-labeled DAG lipophorin or its treatment with ammonium chloride showed that neither a membrane-bound lipoprotein lipase nor lipophorin endocytosis is a relevant pathway to transfer or to storage lipids into fat body, respectively. Treatment of fat body with suramin caused a 50% inhibition in [(3)H]DAG transfer from lipophorin. Treatment of [(3)H]DAG-labeled fat body with lipase significantly reduced the amount of [(3)H]DAG associated with the tissue, suggesting that the lipid is still on the external surface of the membrane. Whether this lipid represents irreversibly adsorbed lipophorin or a DAG lipase-sensitive pool is unknown. Nevertheless, these results indicate that the main pathway for DAG transfer from lipophorin to fat body is via LTP and receptor-mediated processes.<p>

This report describes a simple method for the bioremediation of selenium from agricultural drainage water. A medium-packed pilot-scale biological reactor system, inoculated with the selenate-respiring bacterium Thauera selenatis, was constructed at the Panoche Water District, San Joaquin Valley, Calif. The reactor was used to treat drainage water (7.6 liters/min) containing both selenium and nitrate. Acetate (5 mM) was the carbon source-electron donor reactor feed. Selenium oxyanion concentrations (selenate plus selenite) in the drainage water were reduced by 98%, to an average of 12 (plusmn) 9 (mu)g/liter. Frequently (47% of the sampling days), reactor effluent concentrations of less than 5 (mu)g/liter were achieved. Denitrification was also observed in this system; nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the drainage water were reduced to 0.1 and 0.01 mM, respectively (98% reduction). Analysis of the reactor effluent showed that 91 to 96% of the total selenium recovered was elemental selenium; 97.9% of this elemental selenium could be removed with Nalmet 8072, a new, commercially available precipitant-coagulant. Widespread use of this system (in the Grasslands Water District) could reduce the amount of selenium deposited in the San Joaquin River from 7,000 to 140 lb (ca. 3,000 to 60 kg)/year.<p>

SEM studies of xylem of stems of Nuphar reveal a novel feature, not previously reported for any angiosperm. Pit membranes of tracheid end walls are composed of coarse fibrils, densest on the distal (outside surface, facing the pit of an adjacent cell) surface of the pit membrane of a tracheid, thinner, and disposed at various levels on the lumen side of a pit membrane. The fibrils tend to be randomly oriented on the distal face of the pit membrane; the innermost fibrils facing the lumen take the form of longitudinally oriented strands. Where most abundantly present, the fibrils tend to be disposed in a spongiform, three-dimensional pattern. Pores that interconnect tracheids are present within the fibrillar meshwork. Pit membranes on lateral walls of stem tracheids bear variously diminished versions of this pattern. Pits of root tracheids are unlike those of stems in that the lumen side of pit membranes bears a reticulum revealed on the outer surface of the tracheid after most of the thickness of a pit membrane is shaved away by the sectioning process. No fibrillar texturing is visible on the root tracheid pits when they are viewed from the inside of a tracheid. Tracheid end walls of roots do contain pores of various sizes in pit membranes. These root and stem patterns were seen in six species representing the two sections of Nuphar, plus one intersectional hybrid, as well as in one collection of Nymphaea, included for purposes of comparison. Differences between root and stem tracheids with respect to microstructure are consistent in all species studied. Microstructural patterns reported here for stem tracheid pits of Nymphaeaceae are not like those of Chloranthaceae, Illiciaceae, or other basal angiosperms. They are not referable to any of the patterns reported for early vascular plants. The adaptational nature of the pit membrane structure in these tracheids is not apparent; microstructure of pit membranes in basal angiosperms is more diverse than thought prior to study with SEM.<p>

The high sterol concentration in eukaryotic cell membranes is thought to influence membrane properties such as permeability, fluidity and microdomain formation. Drosophila cannot synthesize sterols, but do require them for development. Does this simply reflect a requirement for sterols in steroid hormone biosynthesis, or is bulk membrane sterol also essential in Drosophila? If the latter is true, how do they survive fluctuations in sterol availability and maintain membrane homeostasis? Here, we show that Drosophila require both bulk membrane sterol and steroid hormones in order to complete adult development. When sterol availability is restricted, Drosophila larvae modulate their growth to maintain membrane sterol levels within tight limits. When dietary sterol drops below a minimal threshold, larvae arrest growth and development in a reversible manner. Strikingly, membrane sterol levels in arrested larvae are dramatically reduced (dropping sixfold on average) in most tissues except the nervous system. Thus, sterols are dispensable for maintaining the basic membrane biophysical properties required for cell viability; these functions can be performed by non-sterol lipids when sterols are unavailable. However, bulk membrane sterol is likely to have essential functions in specific tissues during development. In tissues in which sterol levels drop, the overall level of sphingolipids increases and the proportion of different sphingolipid variants is altered. These changes allow survival, but not growth, when membrane sterol levels are low. This relationship between sterols and sphingolipids could be an ancient and conserved principle of membrane homeostasis.<p>

A novel solid phase microextraction Arrow (SPME Arrow) system has been applied for the first time to determine synthetic musk fragrances in fish samples. The lack of regulation concerning the concentration of musk fragrances in fish along with the risk associated to these compounds has led to an increased development of analytical methods on this topic. This study applies SPME Arrow followed by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (ion trap) to determine nine musk fragrances and compares this novel technique with its predecessor (SPME). Parameters such as type of coating, extraction time and temperature as well as water addition were optimized to achieve higher sensitivity. Results show that detection limits ranging between 0.5 ng g(-1) (for cashmeran, celestolide, phantolide, tonalide and musk ketone) and 2.5 ng g(-1) (dry weight) (for musk xylene) when SPME Arrow is used instead of a conventional fibre, with an up to ten-fold increase in sensitivity. Moreover, commercial fish samples were analysed using the method developed and galaxolideand tonalidewere quantified at concentrations ranging from 6.5 ng g(-1) to 17.5 ng g(-1) (d.w.) and 2.9 ng g(-1) and 5.1 ng g(-1) (d.w.) in all the species analysed.<p>

Interfaces between complex oxides are emerging as one of the most interesting systems in condensed matter physics. In this special setting, in which translational symmetry is artificially broken, a variety of new and unusual electronic phases can be promoted. Theoretical studies predict complex phase diagrams and suggest the key role of the charge carrier density in determining the systems' ground states. A particularly fascinating system is the conducting interface between the band insulators LaAlO(3) and SrTiO(3) (ref. 3). Recently two possible ground states have been experimentally identified: a magnetic state and a two-dimensional superconducting condensate. Here we use the electric field effect to explore the phase diagram of the system. The electrostatic tuning of the carrier density allows an on/off switching of superconductivity and drives a quantum phase transition between a two-dimensional superconducting state and an insulating state. Analyses of the magnetotransport properties in the insulating state are consistent with weak localization and do not provide evidence for magnetism. The electric field control of superconductivity demonstrated here opens the way to the development of new mesoscopic superconducting circuits.<p>

BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest low-income women of childbearing age may be at risk of suboptimal folate intake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of learner-centered nutrition education on folate intake and food-related behaviors among nonpregnant, low-income women of childbearing age, compared to education unrelated to nutrition. DESIGN: Participants were randomly assigned by recruitment site to receive either the nutrition lesson or a control lesson about resource management. PARTICIPANTS: Nonpregnant, low-income (&lt; or =185% federal poverty level) women of childbearing age (18 to 45 years, n=155) from five California counties. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: Changes in folate intake and other food-related behaviors. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline responses and potential confounders. RESULTS: Adjusting for baseline, participants who received the nutrition education had greater increases in folate intake and use of the Nutrition Facts label than the control group. Change in intake of specific folate-rich foods differed by ethnicity. Participants in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children who received the nutrition education increased folate intake but had no significant changes in other food-related behaviors. Food stamp recipients who received the nutrition education had no significant changes in folate intake but did increase the frequency of eating more than one kind of vegetable each day, compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of learner-centered approaches to nutrition education for low-income audiences, compared to education unrelated to nutrition. Future work is needed to compare learner-centered techniques to traditional pedagogical nutrition education, and to determine whether observed changes from this study persist over the long term.<p>

Both soluble and cell-mediated components are involved in the innate immune response of arthropods. Injection of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, results in the secretion of defensin into the hemolymph of the ixodid tick, Dermacentor variabilis. The presence of the peptide is observed as early as 15 min post-challenge and remains present through 18 h post-challenge. As observed in insects and soft ticks, the transcript for defensin is detected as early as 1 h post-challenge in D. variabilis. RT-PCR resulted in an amplicon of 624 bp with a 225 bp region that translates to a 74 amino acid preprodefensin. The defensin encoding region was amplified, cloned and sequenced from the hemocytes. It appears as though defensin is stored in the granulocytes of the hemolymph and secreted into the hemolymph upon bacterial insult. The role of defensin as a contributing factor in determining vector competency is discussed.<p>

Bacteria and other potential pathogens are cleared rapidly from the body fluids of invertebrates by the immediate response of the innate immune system. Proteolytic cascades, following their initiation by pattern recognition proteins, control several such reactions, notably coagulation, melanisation, activation of the Toll receptor and complement-like reactions. However, there is considerable variation among invertebrates and these cascades, although widespread, are not present in all phyla. In recent years, significant progress has been made in identifying and characterizing these cascades in insects. Notably, recent work has identified several connections and shared principles among the different pathways, suggesting that cross-talk between them may be common.<p>

Melanisation is an important immune response in many invertebrates. Recent evidence also strongly implies that the melanisation (prophenoloxidase activating) cascade is intimately associated with the appearance of factors stimulating cellular defence by aiding phagocytosis and encapsulation reactions. However, some controversy exists in the field, and at least in flies and mosquitoes, the successful combat of some pathogens does not seem to be dependent on phenoloxidase activity. This may be because of redundancy among separate immune mechanisms, inappropriate testing, species differences or a combination thereof. Recently, by using RNA interference against phenoloxidase or in specific host-pathogen interactions where the pathogen prevents melanin production by the host, convincing data have confirmed the importance of this cascade in invertebrate innate immunity.<p>

Cerenius, L. and K. Soderhall (2004). &quot;The prophenoloxidase-activating system in invertebrates.&quot; <u>Immunological Reviews</u> <b>198</b>: 116-126.<p>
A major innate defense system in invertebrates is the melanization of pathogens and damaged tissues. This important process is controlled by the enzyme phenoloxidase (PO) that in turn is regulated in a highly elaborate manner for avoiding unnecessary production of highly toxic and reactive compounds. Recent progress, especially in arthropods, in the elucidation of mechanisms controlling the activation of zymogenic proPO into active PO by a cascade of serine proteinases and other factors is reviewed. The proPO-activating system (proPO system) is triggered by the presence of minute amounts of compounds of microbial origins, such as beta-1,3-glucans, lipopolysaccharides, and peptidoglycans, which ensures that the system will become active in the presence of potential pathogens. The presence of specific proteinase inhibitors prevents superfluous activation. Concomitant with proPO activation, many other immune reactions will be produced, such as the generation of factors with anti-microbial, cytotoxic, opsonic, or encapsulation-promoting activities.<p>

To examine the C(20) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) compositions of Collembola, we raised five species of Collembola on yeast diets, and then quantified body mass, neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) compositions. PLFA content was always less than 5% of dry weight, but NLFA content varied from 5.9% to 29.6% of dry weight, depending upon species. Combined C(20) PUFA proportions of up to 9.2% and 48% were observed in the NLFA and PLFA fractions, respectively, resulting in total C(20) PUFA proportions of up to 19.4% of the total fatty acid compositions of Collembola. C(20) PUFAs were also detected in Collembola specimens from a deciduous woodland at proportions up to 29.7% of the total fatty acid composition. Terrestrial invertebrates generally contain &lt;4% and &lt;22% C(20) PUFAs in PLFAs and NLFAs, respectively; therefore, these results demonstrate that Collembola often possess the highest proportions of C(20) PUFAs yet observed in terrestrial invertebrates. The biochemical reasons for such high C(20) PUFA proportions, which were biosynthesised by the Collembola since these components were absent from the yeast diets, remain unclear. The distinctive fatty acid compositions of Collembola may be useful in soil food web studies utilising fatty acids as biomarkers of trophic behaviour.<p>

A finite element (FE) model with knee-thigh-hip (KTH) and lower-extremity muscles has been developed to study the potential effects of muscle tension on KTH injuries due to knee bolster loadings in frontal crashes. This model was created by remeshing the MADYMO human lower-extremity FE model to account for regional differences in cortical bone thickness, trabecular bone, cortical bone with directionally dependent mechanical properties and Tsai-Wu failure criteria, and articular cartilage. The model includes 35 Hill-type muscles in each lower extremity with masses based on muscle volume. The skeletal response of the model was validated by simulating biomechanical tests without muscle tension, including cadaver skeletal segment impact tests documented in the literature as well as recent tests of seated whole cadavers that were impacted using knee-loading conditions similar to those produced in FMVSS 208 testing. Simulations of knee-to-knee-bolster impacts conducted with and without different levels of lower-extremity muscle activation reported in the literature for braking/bracing suggest that muscle tension has the potential to decrease the externally applied force required to cause KTH fracture, and the potential to increase the likelihood of femoral shaft fracture relative to hip fracture by increasing bending moments in the femoral shaft. However, more reliable and complete data on activation levels of muscles in the lower extremities during vehicle braking and bracing are needed before this effect of muscle tension can be confirmed and before the overall effects of muscle tension on KTH injury can be determined.<p>

This in vitro study compares the mean shear bond strengths of two dentin bonding agents to dry and to moist human dentin. The occlusal surfaces of 60 extracted human molars were ground to produce flat dentin surfaces. The teeth were divided into four groups of 15 specimens each. For Scotchbond Multi-Purpose dentin bonding agent, the teeth were etched, rinsed, and then either blotted with gauze, which left the dentin moist, or dried with compressed air. The primer and adhesive were then applied, and composite cylinders were bonded to the teeth. For Optibond, the teeth were again either blotted with gauze or dried with air. The primer and dual-activated adhesive were applied, and composite cylinders were bonded to the teeth. After storage in room-temperature distilled water for 48 hours, the specimens were thermocycled. Shear bond strength testing was performed at 1 week. Analysis using two-sample t-tests found no significant difference for either product in bond strengths to moist and to dry dentin (P &gt; 0.05). This study indicated that for some current-generation dentin bonding agents, the presence of moisture on dentin surfaces does not compromise short-term bond strength.<p>

The spider Misumenops pallidus (Thomisidae) is commonly found in alfalfa crops. We studied its predatory preferences on potential insect prey, particularly regarding agroecosystems pests. Two kinds of tests were done under normal laboratory conditions: simultaneous presentation of prey (n = 215) and alternative prey test (n = 45). The spiders preferred insects that were mobile, small, without defensive glands and with thin exoskeletons. According to the amount of prey consumed, we established four predation levels: high (&gt; 55%, on adult Drosophila melanogaster flies); intermediate (30%-55% on the defoliator larvae of Rachiplusia nu and adult heteropterans: Horciasinus argentinus and Halticus spegazzinii); and low (10%-30% on the chrysomelids Colapsis sp. and Diabrotica speciosa). The pentatomid Piezodorus guildinii, the curculionid Naupactus sp. and the aphid Acyrthosiphom pisum were not accepted as food. Once the spider captured a prey item it did not accept another, independently of prey item species (82% of trials).<p>

Genomic fluorescent in situ hybridization was employed in the study of the genome organization and evolution of hexaploid oat (Avena sativa L. cv. Sun II, AACCDD, 2n = 6x = 42). Genomic DNAs from two diploid oat species, Avena strigosa (genomic constitution AsAs, 2n = 14) and Avena pilosa (genomic constitution CpCp, 2n = 14), were used as probes in the study. The DNA from A. strigosa labelled 28 of the 42 (2/3) chromosomes of the hexaploid oat, while 14 of the 42 (1/3) chromosomes were labelled with A. pilosa DNA, indicating a close relationship between the A and D genomes. Results also suggested that at least 18 chromosomes (9 pairs) were involved in intergenomic interchanges between the A and C genomes.<p>

The genome of plant-associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 harbors an array of giant gene clusters involved in synthesis of lipopeptides and polyketides with antifungal, antibacterial and nematocidal activity. Five gene clusters, srf, bmy, fen, nrs, dhb, covering altogether 137 kb, were shown to direct synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides surfactin, bacillomycin, fengycin, an unknown peptide, and the iron-siderophore bacillibactin. In addition, one gene cluster encoding enzymes involved in synthesis and export of the antibacterial dipeptide bacilysin is also functional in FZB42. Three gene clusters, mln, bae, and dfn, with a total size of 199 kb were shown to direct synthesis of the antibacterial acting polyketides macrolactin, bacillaene, and difficidin. In total, FZB42 dedicates about 340 kb, corresponding to 8.5% of its total genetic capacity, to synthesis of secondary metabolites. On the contrary, genes involved in ribosome-dependent synthesis of lantibiotics and other peptides are scarce. Apart from two incomplete gene clusters directing immunity against mersacidin and subtilin, only one peptide-like compound has been detected in the culture fluid that inhibits the growth of B. subtilis lacking the alternative sigma factor W.<p>

A flow cytometric procedure was used to analyse the cell surface interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) based on the principle of detecting the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R. The bound IL-6 was visualized by reacting with anti-IL-6 antibody, a second biotinylated antibody to immunoglobulins, fluorescein-conjugated avidin and biotinylated, fluorescein-conjugated bovine serum albumin. Studies with a number of human myeloma cell lines showed that the fluorescence signal from cellular binding of IL-6, and thus IL-6R, could be specifically discerned from the background. The specific IL-6R signal could be semi-quantitatively expressed as the mean channel number of the fluorescence histogram or as relative IL-6R density in relation to a reference cell line, such as U266-BL cells. The relative IL-6R density of various myeloma cell lines thus determined was found to correlate with their sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids in vitro. Quantitatively, calibration of the staining procedure with microbeads that have a defined binding capacity for anti-IL-6 antibody allowed calculation of cellular IL-6R density that yielded results close to that reported with conventional radio-ligand binding assay. Similarly, the cytometric method was applied to the studies of kinetics of IL-6/IL-6R interaction and the cellular IL-6R changes after ligand-binding to provide estimates of IL-6R binding affinity and IL-6R turnover rate. It is suggested that flow cytometric measurement of cellular IL-6R is useful in providing biologically relevant information on myeloma cells.<p>

Percutaneous patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure is increasingly performed for a variety of different conditions and is usually relatively straightforward, with a low adverse event rate and virtually no mortality. In cases with a long PFO tunnel, the &quot;puncture technique&quot; -- utilizing a transseptal puncture -- is performed to achieve better apposition of the septum primum to the septum secundum, and to avoid device deformity. Even though transseptal puncture can be safely performed by experienced operators, there is still a 1-2% risk of cardiac perforation. We report a novel technique to percutaneously close a cardiac perforation that occurred while using the puncture technique for PFO closure using an Amplatzer PFO Occluder. The PFO occluder successfully sealed the perforation, prevented development of cardiac tamponade and avoided the need for surgical intervention in a frail patient. This technique can be applied to other cardiac chamber perforations, especially if iatrogenic. This case illustrates the need to be thoroughly familiar with the cardiac anatomy and to avoid &quot;instinctively&quot; withdrawing the equipment once perforation occurs.<p>

1. Amphetamine-induced c-fos and egr-1 expression in the striatum was used as a model in which to study the effects of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) directed at c-fos. Using direct infusions of ODNs into the striata of animals we have demonstrated that c-fos antisense ODNs retain most of their biological activity with 2- or 3-base substitutions. The c-fos antisense and mismatch ODNs attenuated Fos immunoreactivity but had little effect on Egr-1 immunoreactivity. 2. In another group of studies examining the role of c-fos in amygdala kindling, we have demonstrated that ODNs cause neurotoxic damage following repeated daily infusions into the amygdala. The damage observed was greatly diminished when the time interval between infusions was extended.<p>

Cell cycle control and migration are critical processes during development and maintenance of tissue functions. Recently, primary cilia were shown to take part in coordination of the signaling pathways that control these cellular processes in human health and disease. In this review, we present an overview of the function of primary cilia and the centrosome in the signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle control and migration with focus on ciliary signaling via platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha). We also consider how the primary cilium and the centrosome interact with the extracellular matrix, coordinate Wnt signaling, and modulate cytoskeletal changes that impinge on both cell cycle control and cell migration.<p>

This study was designed to examine whether fetuses with Down syndrome (DS) identified through serum screening are different from those whose mothers have normal serum screening results. It was a retrospective follow-up study of pregnancies where maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) concentrations were measured to identify women at increased risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect (NTD). An enhanced risk for NTD was the only reason for intervention in the screened population. Clinical features of fetuses or children with DS were related to the screening results. A retrospectively calculated term risk of 1/250 classified a pregnancy as having been at an elevated risk of DS. The outcome measures were fetal or neonatal death and severe somatic disease. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and unconjugated oestriol (uE3) were measured retrospectively in frozen samples of the DS pregnancies and the same cut-off level was used for classification (so-called 'triple test'). Ten thousand women were included in the study. Pregnancy outcome was known in 93.5 per cent of the cases. Children with and without anatomic defects were found in all subgroups of test results combinations. All mothers of children with a congenital heart defect (CHD) had a DS risk of &gt; or = 1/250 according to the triple test.<p>

Evolutionary changes in traits that affect both ecological divergence and mating signals could lead to reproductive isolation and the formation of new species. Insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) are potential examples of such dual traits. They form a waxy layer on the cuticle of the insect to maintain water balance and prevent desiccation, while also acting as signaling molecules in mate recognition and chemical communication. Because the synthesis of these hydrocarbons in insect oenocytes occurs through a common biochemical pathway, natural or sexual selection on one role may affect the other. In this review, we explore how ecological divergence in insect CHCs can lead to divergence in mating signals and reproductive isolation. We suggest that the evolution of insect CHCs may be ripe models for understanding ecological speciation.<p>

We report the analysis of 872 cDNA clones from a WSSV-infected white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei gill cDNA library. Comparison against the GenBank protein and nucleotide sequences identified 87% (E &lt; or = 10(-2)) as previously known genes, while 13% are novel sequences. The 601 ESTs (87%) represent transcripts of 276 genes. These genes were categorized into 12 groups according to their functions. The more abundant categories were (1) ribosomal proteins (21%), (2) WSSV transcripts and sequences without homology to proteins deposited in the non-redundant database (15%), (3) hypothetical proteins (12%) which include genes never described in shrimp and (4) metabolism related proteins (9%). We also found genes involved in stress and immune response; and only one involved in ion transport. Full-length sequences of keratinocyte associated protein 2 (KCP2), selenoprotein M (SelM), chicadae, prohibitin and oncoprotein nm23 are reported. Their mRNAs steady state levels in addition to ferritin, changed at different times post-WSSV infection as estimated by RT-PCR. These results suggest that WSSV alters gene expression in gills and has led to the identification of novel white shrimp specific genes.<p>

The antihypertensive drug captopril was found to inhibit the oxidation of low density lipoproteins by copper in a dose dependent manner in vitro. Up to 65% inhibition of oxidation was observed at the concentration of 100 micrograms/ml of captopril. During subsequent studies with patients, captopril protected low density lipoproteins against oxidation slightly better than enalapril, although this difference was not statistically significant. Captopril had no effect on the levels of Lp(a) as compared to the levels established during enalapril treatment.<p>

BACKGROUND: Pleurodesis using both talc slurry and thoracoscopic talc insufflation has been shown to be clinically effective. This study compares these two modalities of pleural talc instillation in an animal model. METHODS: Eleven immature pigs underwent general endotracheal anesthesia. On one side, a slurry of 5 g sterile United States Pharmacopeia talc in 50 mL of saline solution was instilled through a thoracostomy tube. On the other side, the lung was deflated and 5 g of dry talc was insufflated under thoracoscopic visualization. The animals were sacrificed 30 days later, and the quality of pleural adhesions was graded from 0 to 2 (0 = absent; 1 = light; 2 = dense) in each of six regions of each hemithorax. The distribution of adhesions on each side was graded from 0 to 6, according to the number of areas that contained adhesions. RESULTS: One animal died of anesthetic complications. Among the survivors, adhesions produced by both methods were dense and diffuse in 8 of 10 animals, and light and diffuse in 1 animal. One animal had light or absent adhesions on the talc slurry side, and dense and diffuse adhesions on the thoracoscopic talc insufflation side. There was no difference between the techniques for density of adhesion scores (talc slurry, 9.9 +/- 2.2; thoracoscopic talc insufflation, 10.0 +/- 2.5) or distribution of adhesion scores (talc slurry, 5.5 +/- 1.0; thoracoscopic talc insufflation, 5.8 +/- 0.4) (p &gt; 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: Effective pleurodesis in a porcine model can be obtained with either talc slurry or thoracoscopic talc insufflation.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Elevated plasma triglyceride concentration is a component of the insulin resistance syndrome and is commonly associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and coronary heart disease. The goal of our study was to perform a genome-wide linkage scan to identify genetic regions that influence variation in plasma triglyceride levels in families that are enriched with individuals with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used phenotypic and genotypic data from 1,026 individuals distributed across 294 Mexican-American families, who were ascertained for type 2 diabetes, from the Veterans Administration Genetic Epidemiology Study (VAGES). Plasma triglyceride values were transformed, and a variance-components technique was used to conduct multipoint linkage analysis. RESULTS: After adjusting for the significant effects of sex and BMI, heritability for plasma triglycerides was estimated as 46 +/- 7% (P &lt; 0.0001). Multipoint linkage analysis yielded the strongest evidence for linkage of plasma triglycerides near marker D12S391 on chromosome 12p (logarithm of odds [LOD] = 2.4). Our linkage signal on chromosome 12p provides independent replication of a similar finding in another Mexican-American sample from the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (SAFDS). Combined multipoint linkage analysis of the VAGES and SAFDS data yielded significant evidence for linkage of plasma triglycerides to a genetic location between markers GATA49D12 and D12S391 on 12p (LOD = 3.8, empirical P value = 2.0 x 10(-5)). This region on 12p harbors the gene-encoding adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2), where we previously have shown that multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with plasma triglyceride concentrations in the SAFDS. In the present study, we provided suggestive evidence in favor of association for rs929434 with triglyceride concentrations in the VAGES. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results provide strong evidence for a major locus on chromosome 12p that influences plasma triglyceride levels in Mexican Americans.<p>

Ethosuximide is a medication used to treat seizure disorders in humans, and we previously demonstrated that ethosuximide can delay age-related changes and extend the lifespan of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The mechanism of action of ethosuximide in lifespan extension is unknown, and elucidating how ethosuximide functions is important for defining endogenous processes that influence lifespan and for exploring the potential of ethosuximide as a therapeutic for age-related diseases. To identify genes that mediate the activity of ethosuximide, we conducted a genetic screen and identified mutations in two genes, che-3 and osm-3, that cause resistance to ethosuximide-mediated toxicity. Mutations in che-3 and osm-3 cause defects in overlapping sets of chemosensory neurons, resulting in defective chemosensation and an extended lifespan. These findings suggest that ethosuximide extends lifespan by inhibiting the function of specific chemosensory neurons. This model is supported by the observation that ethosuximide-treated animals displayed numerous phenotypic similarities with mutants that have chemosensory defects, indicating that ethosuximide inhibits chemosensory function. Furthermore, ethosuximide extends lifespan by inhibiting chemosensation, since the long-lived osm-3 mutants were resistant to the lifespan extension caused by ethosuximide. These studies demonstrate a novel mechanism of action for a lifespan-extending drug and indicate that sensory perception has a critical role in controlling lifespan. Sensory perception also influences the lifespan of Drosophila, suggesting that sensory perception has an evolutionarily conserved role in lifespan control. These studies highlight the potential of ethosuximide and related drugs that modulate sensory perception to extend lifespan in diverse animals.<p>

Scorpine has a unique amino acid sequence, similar only to some cecropins in its N-terminal segment and to some defensins in its C-terminal region. Its gene was cloned from a cDNA library.<p>

Phenoloxidases (POs) occur in all organisms and are involved in skin and hair coloring in mammals, and initiating melanization in wound healing. Mutation or overexpression of PO can cause albinism or melanoma, respectively. SDS can convert inactive PO and the oxygen carrier hemocyanin (Hc) into enzymatically active PO. Here we present single-particle cryo-EM maps at subnanometer resolution and pseudoatomic models of the 24-oligomeric Hc from scorpion Pandinus imperator in resting and SDS-activated states. Our structural analyses led to a plausible mechanism of Hc enzyme PO activation: upon SDS activation, the intrinsically flexible Hc domain I twists away from domains II and III in each subunit, exposing the entrance to the active site; this movement is stabilized by enhanced interhexamer and interdodecamer interactions, particularly in the central linker subunits. This mechanism could be applicable to other type 3 copper proteins, as the active site is highly conserved.<p>

To help inform healthcare treatment practices and funding decisions, an economic evaluation was conducted to compare the two leading gonadotrophins used for IVF in Belgium. Based on the results of a recently published meta-analysis, a simulated decision tree model was constructed with four states: (i) fresh cycle, (ii) cryopreserved cycle, (iii) live birth and (iv) treatment withdrawal. Gonadotrophin costs were based on highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (HP-HMG; Menopur) and recombinant FSH (rFSH) alpha (Gonal-F). After one fresh and one cryopreserved cycle the average treatment cost with HP-HMG was lower than with rFSH (HP-HMG euro3635; rFSH euro4103). The average cost saving per person started on HP-HMG when compared with rFSH was euro468. Additionally, the average costs per live birth of HP-HMG and rFSH were found to be significantly different: HP-HMG euro9996; rFSH euro13,009 (P &lt; 0.0001). HP-HMG remained cost-saving even after key parameters in the model were varied in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Treatment with HP-HMG was found to be the dominant treatment strategy in IVF because of improved live birth rates and lower costs. Within a fixed healthcare budget, the cost-savings achieved using HP-HMG would allow for the delivery of additional IVF cycles.<p>

Following observation of fatigue syndromes in people who have been occupationally exposed to pesticides and insecticides which exert their toxicity through the GABAa receptor, we have formulated the hypothesis that fatigue syndromes in general may be secondary to altered sensitivity of the GABAa receptor. We discuss the possible involvement of organochlorine compounds which are widespread in the environment. Organophosphate compounds may have similar toxic effects through damaged cholinergic input to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus where cholinergic and GABAergic transmission are closely linked.<p>

Five amphipathic peptides with antimicrobial, hemolytic, and insecticidal activity were isolated from the crude venom of the wolf spider Oxyopes kitabensis. The peptides, named oxyopinins, are the largest linear cationic amphipathic peptides from the venom of a spider that have been chemically characterized at present. According to their primary structure Oxyopinin 1 is composed of 48 amino acid residues showing extended sequence similarity to the ant insecticidal peptide ponericinL2 and to the frog antimicrobial peptide dermaseptin. Oxyopinins 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d have highly similar sequences. At least 27 out of 37 amino acid residues are conserved. They also show a segment of sequence similar to ponericinL2. Circular dichroism analyses showed that the secondary structure of the five peptides is essentially alpha-helical. Oxyopinins showed disrupting activities toward both biological membranes and artificial vesicles, particularly to those rich in phosphatidylcholine. Electrophysiological recordings performed on insect cells (Sf9) showed that the oxyopinins produce a drastic reduction of cell membrane resistance by opening non-selective ion channels. Additionally, a new paralytic neurotoxin named Oxytoxin 1 was purified from the same spider venom. It contains 69 amino acid residue cross-linked by five disulfide bridges. Application of mixtures containing oxyopinins and Oxytoxin 1 to insect larvae showed a potentiation phenomenon, by which an increase lethality effect is observed. These results suggest that the linear amphipathic peptides in spider venoms and neuropeptides cooperate to capture insects efficiently.<p>

We have studied the inactivation of high-voltage-activated (HVA), omega-conotoxin-sensitive, N-type Ca2+ current in embryonic chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Voltage steps from -80 to 0 mV produced inward Ca2+ currents that inactivated in a biphasic manner and were fit well with the sum of two exponentials (with time constants of approximately 100 ms and &gt; 1 s). As reported previously, upon depolarization of the holding potential to -40 mV, N current amplitude was significantly reduced and the rapid phase of inactivation all but eliminated (Nowycky, M. C., A. P. Fox, and R. W. Tsien. 1985. Nature. 316:440-443; Fox, A. P., M. C. Nowycky, and R. W. Tsien. 1987a. Journal of Physiology. 394:149-172; Swandulla, D., and C. M. Armstrong. 1988.

H., and K. Dunlap. 1992. Journal of Neuroscience. 12:906-914). Such kinetic properties might be explained by a model in which N channels inactivate by both fast and slow voltage-dependent processes. Alternatively, kinetic models of Ca-dependent inactivation suggest that the biphasic kinetics and holding-potential-dependence of N current inactivation could be due to a combination of Ca-dependent and slow voltage-dependent inactivation mechanisms. To distinguish between these possibilities we have performed several experiments to test for the presence of Ca-dependent inactivation. Three lines of evidence suggest that N channels inactivate in a Ca-dependent manner. (a) The total extent of inactivation increased 50%, and the ratio of rapid to slow inactivation increased approximately twofold when the concentration of the Ca2+ buffer, EGTA, in the patch pipette was reduced from 10 to 0.1 mM. (b) With low intracellular EGTA concentrations (0.1 mM), the ratio of rapid to slow inactivation was additionally increased when the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was raised from 0.5 to 5 mM. (c) Substituting Na+ for Ca2+ as the permeant ion eliminated the rapid phase of inactivation. Other results do not support the notion of current-dependent inactivation, however. Although high intracellular EGTA (10 mM) or BAPTA (5 mM) concentrations suppressed the rapid phase inactivation, they did not eliminate it. Increasing the extracellular Ca2+ from 0.5 to 5 mM had little effect on this residual fast inactivation, indicating that it is not appreciably sensitive to Ca2+ influx under these conditions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)<p>

Maternally inherited mitochondria and other cytoplasmic organelles play essential roles supporting the development of early embryos and their germ cells. Using methods that resolve individual organelles, we studied the origin of oocyte and germ plasm-associated mitochondria during Drosophila oogenesis. Mitochondria partition equally on the spindle during germline stem cell and cystocyte divisions. Subsequently, a fraction of cyst mitochondria and Golgi vesicles associates with the fusome, moves through the ring canals, and enters the oocyte in a large mass that resembles the Balbiani bodies of Xenopus, humans and diverse other species. Some mRNAs, including oskar RNA, specifically associate with the oocyte fusome and a region of the Balbiani body prior to becoming localized. Balbiani body development requires an intact fusome and microtubule cytoskeleton as it is blocked by mutations in hu-li tai shao, while egalitarian mutant follicles accumulate a large mitochondrial aggregate in all 16 cyst cells. Initially, the Balbiani body supplies virtually all the mitochondria of the oocyte, including those used to form germ plasm, because the oocyte ring canals specifically block inward mitochondrial transport until the time of nurse cell dumping. Our findings reveal new similarities between oogenesis in Drosophila and vertebrates, and support our hypothesis that developing oocytes contain specific mechanisms to ensure that germ plasm is endowed with highly functional organelles.<p>

AIMS: To examine the prevalence of asthma symptoms in a random population sample of New Zealand adults aged 20-44 years drawn from the general and Maori electoral rolls as phase I of an international study of asthma prevalence. METHODS: Subjects aged 20-44 years in Auckland, Hawkes Bay, Wellington and Christchurch, were selected randomly from the electoral rolls and sent a one page screening questionnaire, asking about respiratory symptoms, asthma attacks and asthma treatment. They were also asked to record their ethnic affiliation. Nonresponders were subsequently sent two written reminders followed by a telephone questionnaire where possible. RESULTS: A response rate of 84% was achieved. The study found a high prevalence of asthma symptoms, with 26% reporting wheezing in the last year, 8% experiencing an attack of asthma in the last year and 9% currently using asthma medication. Females were more likely to have had wheezing in the last year (26.6%) and be on treatment for asthma (9.8%) compared with males (24.7% and 7.5% respectively). Small regional differences were found with more reported symptoms and asthma treatment in Wellington and Christchurch, compared with Auckland and Hawkes Bay. Maori were more frequently symptomatic (35.2%) than nonPolynesian (24.8%) but were no more likely to report an attack of asthma (Maori 9.0%, nonPolynesian 7.7%) or be currently receiving asthma treatment (Maori 10.0%, nonPolynesian 8.6%). Asthma symptoms tended to decline with age in non Maori but increased with age in Maori. Adjustment of prevalence rates by two independent methods suggests that nonresponse bias has not significantly inflated these rates. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of asthma and their treatment are common in young New Zealanders, affecting one in three Maori and one in four nonMaori. One in ten of this adult population currently receive asthma treatment.<p>

BACKGROUND: The diversity of longevities encountered in wildlife is one of the most intriguing problems in biology. Evolutionary biologists have proposed different theories to explain how longevity variability may be driven by bad genes expression in late life or by gene pleiotropic effects. This reflexion has stimulated, in the last ten years, an active research on the proximal mechanisms that can shape lifespan. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), i.e., the by-products of oxidative metabolism, have emerged as the main proximate cause of ageing. Because ROS are mainly produced by the mitochondria, their production is linked to metabolic rate, and this may explain the differences in longevity between large and small species. However, their implication in the sex difference in longevity within a species has never been tested, despite the fact that these differences are widespread in the animal kingdom. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mitochondrial superoxide production of hemolymph immune cells and antioxidant and oxidative damages plasma levels were measured in adult male and female B. albopilosa at different ages. We found that female spiders are producing less mitochondrial superoxide, are better protected against oxidative attack and are then suffering less oxidative damages than males at adulthood. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In tarantulas, once reaching sexual maturity, males have a life expectancy reduced to 1 to 2 years, while females can still live for 20 years, in spite of the fact that females continue to grow and moult. This study evidences an increased exposure of males to oxidative stress due to an increase in mitochondrial superoxide production and a decrease in hemolymph antioxidant defences. Such a phenomenon is likely to be part of the explanation for the sharp reduction of longevity accompanying male tarantula maturity. This opens several fundamental research roads in the future to better understand how reproduction and longevity are linked in an original ageing model.<p>

The role of cholesterol in the thermal adaptation of biological membranes is explored. Physical and chemical responses of membranes to acclimation temperature were evaluated using plasma membrane domains (basolateral and brush border) prepared from intestinal epithelia of 5- and 20 &amp;deg;C-acclimated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Basolateral membranes (BLMs) exhibit perfect homeoviscous efficacy (indicated by fluorescence depolarization using 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene), although cholesterol content does not change with acclimation temperature (molar ratios of cholesterol to phospholipid are 0.23&amp;plusmn; 0.01 from 5 &amp;deg;C-acclimated fish and 0.25&amp;plusmn;0.02 from 20&amp;deg;C-acclimated fish; mean &amp;plusmn; s.e.m.). Reductions (greater than 30 %) in each of the two major saturated fatty acids (16:0 and 18:0), and a 42 % increase in the polyunsaturate 22:6 (n-3) are found in BLMs from fish acclimated to 5 &amp;deg;C compared with membranes from warm-acclimated animals, suggesting that the phospholipid acyl chain composition determines the physical properties of BLMs. In marked contrast, brush-border membranes (BBMs) display opposite trends. BBMs from 5 &amp;deg;C-acclimated fish are more ordered than BBMs from 20 &amp;deg;C-acclimated fish (inverse compensation). Cholesterol content expressed relative to protein or relative to total polar lipid (phospholipid plus glycolipid) is significantly higher in cold- than in warm-acclimated fish, and nearly so (P=0.15) relative to phospholipid (0.31&amp;plusmn;0.03 in 5 &amp;deg;C-acclimated animals and 0.25&amp;plusmn;0.02 in 20 &amp;deg;C-acclimated animals). Only minor changes in the acyl composition of BBMs are induced by temperature acclimation. These results suggest that bile, a constituent of the apical microenvironment, may impose unusual requirements for membrane order and/or stability in the brush border.<p>

BACKGROUND: Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data suggest that Latinos are less likely to be physically active and more likely to be overweight and suffer from resulting complications than are Whites and that within the Latino population, Latina women are especially at risk. Therefore, promoting physical activity among Latinos, and understanding gender participation patterns within that population, is particularly important. One strategy for encouraging physical activity is to promote active uses of public parks. METHODS: A national, multiyear, multisite study funded by the USDA Forest Service sought to understand use of public parks by Latinos and Latinas in Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and Chicago. RESULTS: More than 50% of our sample visited parks to engage in physical activity, and in part, activity choice was related to gender. Furthermore, nearly half of all respondents walked to city park sites, whereas few or none walked to state or regional park sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that Latinos are using some parks repeatedly and, in the case of city parks, are using them for physical as well as social activity. Therefore, we suggest specific ways that parks could be managed to encourage more physical activity while taking into account gender variations.<p>

Osteoarthritis (OA) resulting from trauma, degenerative or age-related disease presents a major clinical challenge due to the limited repair capacity of articular cartilage. This poor self-repair capacity of osteochondral defects has resulted in the development of a wide variety of new treatment approaches. Although the use of chondrocytes in applications of cartilage tissue engineering is still prevalent, concerns associated with donor-site morbidity, cell de-differentiation and the limited lifespan of these cells have brought the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the forefront of such applications. Therefore, in the last two decades MSCs have come into the focus of connective tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and have become increasingly sought after as an alternative cell source for improving well-established methods of osteochondrotic cartilage defect repair such as the Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation method, but are also being tested as an ideal cell source in combination with newly developed implantable scaffolds or as a target/carrier cell in other new concepts of regenerative medicine. However, up to now, although in animal models MSCs have already shown significant potential for cartilage repair and novel approaches using MSCs as an alternative cell source to patient-derived chondrocytes are being tested, much more research is needed before feasible clinical application of MSCs becomes reality.<p>

In the framework of the FP7 ECsafeSeafood project, 62 seafood samples commercialized in Europe Union from several representative species - mackerel, tuna, salmon, seabream, cod, monkfish, crab, shrimp, octopus, perch and plaice - were analysed for residues of 21 personal care products (PCPs), including 11 UV-filters (UV-Fs) and 10 musk fragrances (musks). PCPs analysis were performed by Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS), combined with liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) or dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE), followed by gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The results showed the presence in a wide range of samples of nine out of eleven UV-Fs compounds analysed, namely 2-ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS), 2-ethylhexyl,4-methoxycinnamate (EHMC), 4-methylbenzylidenecamphor (4-MBC), benzophenone-1 (BP1), benzophenone-3 (BP3), isoamyl-4-methoxycinnamate (IMC), 2,2'-dihydroxy-4,4'-dimethoxybenzophenone (DHMB), homosalate (HS), and octocrylene (OC), whereas galaxolide (HHCB), galaxolide lactone (HHCB-lactone), and tonalide (AHTN) were the most found musks. The potential risks to human health associated with the exposure to eight of the more prevalent PCPs - EHS, EHMC, 4-MBC, BP1, BP3, IMC, HHCB, and AHTN - through seafood consumption were assessed for consumers from five European countries (Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain). Results showed that the human exposure to UV-Fs and musks estimated from the concentration values found in seafood and the daily consumption of concerned seafood species, were far below toxicological reference values.<p>

Methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase (MT1) is the first of two enzymes involved in the transmethylation reaction from methanol to 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid in Methanosarcina barkeri. MT1 only binds the methyl group of methanol when the cobalt atom of its corrinoid prosthetic groups is present in the highly reduced Co(I) state. Formation of this redox state requires H2, hydrogenase, methyltransferase activation protein, and ATP. Optical and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies were employed to determine the oxidation states and coordinating ligands of the corrinoids of MT1 during the activation process. Purified MT1 contained 1.7 corrinoids per enzyme with cobalt in the fully oxidized Co(III) state. Water and N-3 of the 5-hydroxybenzimidazolyl base served as the upper and lower ligands, respectively. Reduction to the Co(II) level was accomplished by H2 and hydrogenase. The cob(II)amide of MT1 had the base coordinated at this stage. Subsequent addition of methyltransferase activation protein and ATP resulted in the formation of base-uncoordinated Co(II) MT1. The activation mechanism is discussed within the context of a proposed model and compared to those described for other corrinoid-containing methyl group transferring proteins.<p>

The ammonium permease Mep2p mediates ammonium uptake and also induces filamentous growth in the human-pathogenic yeast Candida albicans in response to nitrogen limitation. The C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Mep2p contains a signaling domain that is not required for ammonium transport but is essential for Mep2p-dependent morphogenesis. Progressive C-terminal truncations showed Y433 to be the last amino acid that is essential for the induction of filamentous growth, thereby delimiting the Mep2p signaling domain. To understand in more detail how the signaling activity of Mep2p is regulated by ammonium availability and transport, we mutated conserved amino acid residues that have been implicated in ammonium binding or uptake. Mutation of D180, which has been proposed to mediate initial contact with extracellular ammonium, or the pore-lining residues H188 and H342 abolished Mep2p expression, indicating that these residues are important for protein stability. Mutation of F239, which together with F126 is thought to form an extracytosolic gate to the conductance channel, abolished both ammonium uptake and Mep2p-dependent filament formation, despite proper localization of the protein. On the other hand, mutation of W167, which is assumed to participate with Y122, F126, and S243 in the recruitment and coordination of the ammonium ion at the extracytosolic side of the cell membrane, also abolished filament formation without having a strong impact on ammonium transport, demonstrating that extracellular alterations in Mep2p can affect intracellular signaling. Mutation of Y122 reduced ammonium uptake much more strongly than mutation of W167 but still allowed efficient filament formation, indicating that the signaling activity of Mep2p is not directly correlated with its transport activity. These results provide important insights into ammonium transport and control of morphogenesis by Mep2p in C. albicans.<p>

Betacellulin (BTC), a ligand of the epidermal growth factor receptor, has been shown to promote growth and differentiation of pancreatic beta-cells and to improve glucose metabolism in experimental diabetic rodent models. We employed transgenic mice (BTC-tg) to investigate the effects of long-term BTC overabundance on islet structure and glucose metabolism. Expression of BTC is increased in transgenic islets, which show normal structure and distribution of the different endocrine cell types, without pathological alterations. BTC-tg mice exhibit lower fasted glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance associated with increased glucose-induced insulin secretion. Surprisingly, quantitative stereological analyses revealed that, in spite of increased cell proliferation, the islet and beta-cell volumes were unchanged in BTC-tg mice, suggesting enhanced cell turnover. Insulin secretion in vitro was significantly higher in transgenic islets in medium containing high glucose (11.2 or 16.7mM) as compared to control islets. Our results demonstrate that long-term BTC overabundance does not alter pancreatic islet structure and beta-cell mass, but enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion in vivo as well as in vitro.<p>

It has now been established that infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary for the development of most cervical cancers. HPV is not sufficient for the development of cancer. Other exposures or host factors are necessary for cancer to occur. As part of an ongoing, population-based case-control study of invasive cervical cancer, we investigated the role of cigarette smoking, oral contraceptive (OC) use, and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) as potential cofactors with HPV in the development of cervical cancer. Residents of three counties in western Washington State who were diagnosed with invasive squamous cell cervical cancer (n = 314) from January 1986 through December 1992 were interviewed about their sexual, reproductive, contraceptive, and cigarette smoking histories. Similar information was obtained from control women identified through random digit dialing (n = 672). The sera from 206 cases and 522 controls were tested for both HPV 16 capsid antibodies and HSV-2 antibodies. PCR was used to test paraffin-embedded tumor tissues for the presence of HPV DNA types 6, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, and 39. Women with cervical cancer were more likely to be current smokers at diagnosis than population controls [relative risk (RR), 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.8-3.4]. The risk associated with smoking was present to a similar extent among women positive and negative for HPV as measured by HPV 16 capsid antibodies and HPV DNA in the tumor tissue (cases). OC use was only important if first use was at an early age, particularly ages &lt; or = 17 years (RR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8). There was only a slight risk for cervical cancer associated with antibodies to HSV-2 (RR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7). However, when we stratified by markers of HPV exposure, we found a significant increase in risk associated with HSV-2 among women negative for HPV 16 antibodies (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0), which was strengthened when we confined our analysis to cases whose tumors were HPV DNA negative (RR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6-8.0). There was no indication that cigarette smoking, OC use, or HSV-2 infection influence the ability of HPV infection to cause invasive cervical cancer. OC use may only be important in the etiology of invasive squamous cell cervical tumors if the use occurs at a critical time in the development of a woman's reproductive tract, at ages &lt; or = 17 years. The majority of risk associated with HSV-2 was confined to HPV-negative tumors, indicating a possible separate pathway to disease that may account for 5-10% of invasive cervical cancers.<p>

Daly, A. K., et al. (1994). &quot;Genotyping for polymorphisms in xenobiotic metabolism as a predictor of disease susceptibility.&quot; <u>Environmental Health Perspectives</u> <b>102 Suppl 9</b>: 55-61.<p>
Polymorphisms in many xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes occur leading to variation in the level of enzyme expression in vivo. Enzymes showing such polymorphisms include the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, and CYP2E1 and the phase two metabolism enzymes glutathione S-transferase MI (GSTMI) and arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2). In the past, these polymorphisms have been studied by phenotyping using in vivo administration of probe drugs. However, the mutations which give rise to several of these polymorphisms have now been identified and genotyping assays for polymorphisms in CYP1A1, CYP2A6, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, GSTMI, and NAT2 have been developed. Specific phenotypes for several of the polymorphic enzymes have been associated with increased susceptibility to malignancy, particularly lung and bladder cancer, and Parkinson's disease. These associations are likely to be due to altered activation or detoxication of chemicals initiating these diseases, including components of tobacco smoke and neurotoxins. The substrate specificity and tissue distribution of polymorphic enzymes implicated in disease causation discussed with particular reference to previously described disease-phenotype associations.<p>

PURPOSE: To assess whether blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) values, extracted with the Patlak model from the second perfusion CT (PCT) contrast bolus, are significantly lower than the values extracted from the first bolus in the same patient. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 125 consecutive patients (29 with acute hemispheric stroke and 96 without stroke) who underwent a PCT study using a prolonged acquisition time up to 3 min were retrospectively identified. The Patlak model was applied to calculate the rate of contrast leakage out of the vascular compartment. Patlak plots were created from the arterial and parenchymal time enhancement curves obtained in multiple regions of interest drawn in ischemic brain tissue and in nonischemic brain tissue. The slope of a regression line fit to the Patlak plot was used as an indicator of BBBP. Square roots of the mean squared errors and correlation coefficients were used to describe the quality of the linear regression model. This was performed separately for the first and the second PCT bolus. Results from the first and the second bolus were compared in terms of BBBP values and the quality of the linear model fitted to the Patlak plot, using generalized estimating equations with robust variance estimation. RESULTS: BBBP values from the second bolus were not lower than BBBP values from the first bolus in either nonischemic brain tissue [estimated mean with 95% confidence interval: 1.42 (1.10-1.82) ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) for the first bolus versus 1.64 (1.31-2.05) ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) for the second bolus, p = 1.00] or in ischemic tissue [1.04 (0.97-1.12) ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) for the first bolus versus 1.19 (1.11-1.28) ml x 100 g(-1)min(-1) for the second bolus, p = 0.79]. Compared to regression models from the first bolus, the Patlak regression models obtained from the second bolus were of similar or slightly better quality. This was true both in nonischemic and ischemic brain tissue. CONCLUSION: The contrast material from the first bolus of contrast for PCT does not negatively influence measurements of BBBP values from the second bolus. The second bolus can thus be used to increase anatomical coverage of BBBP assessment using PCT.<p>

High performance liquid chromatography coupled to an ultraviolet, diode array or fluorescence detector (HPLC/UV-FLD) has been used to set up a method to detect the 15(+1) EU priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in food supplements covering the categories of dried plants and plant extracts excluding oily products. A mini validation was performed and the following parameters have been determined: limit of detection, limit of quantification, precision, recovery and linearity. They were in close agreement with quality criteria described in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 333/2007 concerning the PAH benzo[a]pyrene in foodstuffs, except the not fluorescent cyclopenta[c,d]pyrene for which the UV detection leads to a higher limit of detection. Analysis of twenty commercial food supplements covering mainly the class of dried plants was performed to evaluate their PAHs contamination levels and to test the applicability of the method to various plant matrices. Fifty percent of analyzed samples showed concentration exceeding 2 microgkg(-1) for one or more PAHs.<p>

Correct placement of the tibial and femoral bone tunnel is prerequisite to a successful anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This study compares the resulting radiographic femoral bone tunnel position of two commonly used techniques for arthroscopically assisted drilling of the femoral bone tunnel: the transtibial approach or drilling through the anteromedial arthroscopy portal. The resulting bone tunnel position was assessed in postoperative knee radiographs of 70 patients after ACL reconstruction. Three independent observers identified the femoral bone tunnel and determined its position in the lateral and A-P view. Differences in femoral tunnel position between transtibial and anteromedial drilling were evaluated. In the sagittal plane, significantly more femoral bone tunnels were positioned close to the reference value using an anteromedial drilling technique (86%) when compared to transtibial drilling (57%). Drilling through the transtibial tunnel resulted in a significantly more anterior position of the femoral tunnel. In the frontal plane, femoral bone tunnels which were placed through the anteromedial arthroscopy portal displayed a significantly greater angulation towards the lateral condylar cortex (50.92 degrees ) when compared to transtibial drilling (58.82 degrees ). In conclusion, drilling the femoral tunnel through the anteromedial arthroscopy portal results in a radiographic femoral bone tunnel position which is suggested to allow stabilization of both anterior tibial translation and rotational instability when using a single bundle reconstruction technique. Further studies may evaluate if there are any clinical advantages using the anteromedial portal technique.<p>

We have investigated the interaction of the uncommonly large periplasmic P2 loop of the MalF subunit of the maltose ATP-binding cassette transporter (MalFGK(2)) from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium with maltose binding protein (MalE) by site-specific chemical cross-linking in the assembled transport complex. We focused on possible distance changes between two pairs of residues of the P2 loop and MalE during the transport cycle. The distance between MalF(S205C) and MalE(T80C) ( approximately 5 A) remained unchanged under all conditions tested. Cross-linking did not affect the ATPase activity of the complex. The distance between MalF(T177C) and MalE(T31C) changed from approximately 10 A to approximately 5 A upon binding of ATP (or maltose, with a less pronounced result) and was reset to approximately 10 A after hydrolysis of one ATP. A cross-link ( approximately 25 A) between MalF(S205C) and MalE(T31C) was observed only when the transporter resided in a transition state-like conformation, as was the case after vanadate trapping or in a binding protein-independent mutant, both of which are characterized by tight binding of unliganded MalE to the transporter. Thus, we propose that the observed cross-link is indicative of catalytic intermediates of the transporter. Together, our results strengthen the notion that the MalF P2 loop plays an important role in intersubunit communication. In particular, this loop is involved in keeping MalE in close contact with the transporter. The data are discussed with respect to a crystal structure and current transport models.<p>

Hypercholesterolemia induces venous vasomotor dysfunction. This study examines the endothelial and smooth muscle cell vasoreactivity of external jugular veins from rabbits fed either a normal or a 1% cholesterol diet for 8 weeks with and without L-arginine supplementation (2 g/kg day-1 orally for the last 5 weeks). Isometric tension studies were performed on harvested jugular veins. Concentrations of serum cholesterol were 20-fold higher than controls and serum L-arginine twofold higher than untreated animals. Hypercholesterolemia induced hypersensitivity to norepinephrine (p &lt; .05), bradykinin (p &lt; .05), and histamine (p &lt; .05) with a contractile response to serotonin compared to controls. L-Arginine supplementation decreased bradykinin hypersensitivity but had no effect on the changes in norepinephrine serotonin and histamine responses compared to controls. Hypercholesterolemia interfered with relaxation induced by acetylcholine but with L-arginine, normal acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation returned (54 +/- 10%, compared to 40 +/- 14% in control veins; p &gt; .05). Non-endothelium-dependent relaxation to sodium nitroprusside of precontracted veins was unaffected by the presence of high cholesterol concentrations. This study suggests that L-arginine therapy may ameliorate hypercholesterolemia-induced functional abnormalities in endothelial cells.<p>

Davies, M. G., et al. (1996). &quot;The temporal sequence of G-protein expression in intimal hyperplasia.&quot; <u>Journal of Surgical Research</u> <b>63</b>(1): 115-122.<p>
The universal response of a blood vessel to intimal injury is the development of intimal hyperplasia. The etiology of this lesion is not fully understood but is assumed to involve stimulation of receptors on smooth muscle cells with their subsequent proliferation. Many receptor-mediated processes are coupled to G-proteins but little information exists regarding the expression of G-proteins during the development of intimal hyperplasia. This study examines the kinetics of G-protein expression in experimental vein grafts. Male New Zealand White rabbits had a right carotid interposition bypass graft using the ipsilateral external jugular vein. These were harvested on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 postoperatively for histology (n = 3), for in vitro isometric tension studies of potassium chloride, serotonin, bradykinin, and histamine (n = 3), or for Western blot analysis (n = 3) of the G-protein subunits (alpha(i1), alpha(i2), alpha(i3), alpha(S) and beta). The results show that expression of alpha(i3) developed de novo, was detectable by day 1, and continued to increase through day 7, paralleling the development of intimal hyperplasia. The expression of alpha(S) (52 kDa) increased significantly by day 1 and also continued to increase until day 7. In contrast, expression for alpha(i2), alpha(S) (45 kDa) and beta subunits increased at a much slower rate from 1 to 7 days and remained constant thereafter. No alpha(i1) was detected. The contractile response to potassium chloride was significantly reduced (36% of the response in the jugular vein) over the first 7 days and increased to 196% of the jugular vein response at 14 and 28 days. There was minimal response to serotonin, bradykinin, and histamine over the first 7 days. Contractile responses to serotonin increased while those to bradykinin and histamine decreased from 7 to 28 days. This study demonstrates that there are specific changes in alpha(i) and alpha(S) subunits within 24 hr of grafting and that increases in all G-proteins occur in a time dependent manner up to 7 days postoperatively. Microscopic development of intimal hyperplasia occurs from days 3 to 5 and increases rapidly between 7 and 14 days. Changes in the expression of G-proteins in the vein grafts, particularly the alpha(i3) subunit, parallel this formation of intimal hyperplasia. These alterations in G-protein expression do not appear to correlate with G-protein-mediated, contractile responses in the vein grafts.<p>

The development of intimal hyperplasia is now recognized as a major impediment to graft patency and recent studies suggest that the infiltration of polymorphonucleocytes and oxygen free radical mediated injury are involved in the early development of intimal hyperplasia. This study examines the effect of a methylaminochroman, U83836E (Upjohn Company), a second generation lazaroid, in controlling the development of intimal hyperplasia and its associated smooth muscle cell physiological responses in an experimental model of vein bypass grafting. Twenty New Zealand White rabbits had a right carotid interposition bypass graft using the ipsilateral external jugular vein. Ten animals received chronic oral therapy with U83836E (10 mg/kg/day; begun 5 days before surgery and continued until harvest) and 10 control animals received vehicle only. All animals were sacrificed on the 28th postoperative day. Vein grafts were harvested either for morphology/videomorphometry (n = 6 per group) or for in vitro isometric tension studies (n = 4; four 5-mm rings per graft). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the cellular DNA of serum-stimulated rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells (passage 6th to 9th) was also assessed in the presence of increasing concentrations of U83836E (10(-9) to 10(-4) M). Treatment with U83836E produced a 41% decrease in overall mean intimal thickness in the U83836E-treated vein grafts compared to untreated vein grafts (P = 0.003). There were no differences in the medial thicknesses or luminal dimensions of the control and treated vein grafts. U83836E induced norepinephrine hypersensitivity in both jugular veins and vein grafts compared to controls. Other physiological contractile responses of the jugular veins and vein grafts were unaltered by U83836E. U83836E did not inhibit the in vitro [3H] thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner until very high concentration when there was a significant and precipitous response with an IC(50) of 67 microM (114 microgram/ml) and a maximal inhibition of 97 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) at 80 microM (137 microgram/ml). Therapy with the methylaminochroman, U83836E, is beneficial in controlling the early development of intimal hyperplasia without significant changes in the physiological responses of the smooth muscle cells.<p>

Endovascular interventions to salvage failing vein bypass grafts are often associated with suboptimal outcomes. This study examines the effect of experimental vein graft catheter injury on vein graft morphology and vasomotor function. Thirty New Zealand white rabbits underwent a right common carotid interposition vein bypass graft. Ten grafts were harvested at 14 days, 10 were harvested at 28 days, and 10 had a balloon catheter injury induced at 14 days (4 F Fogarty catheter, 0.6 to 0.75 ml water inflation, 3 passes) and these 10 grafts were harvested after an additional 14 days. Morphologic and morphometric determinations (n = 5) or in vitro contractile studies (n = 5) were performed on segments of the vein grafts. Intimal thickness, without any intervention, increased by 84% from 14 to 28 days (p &lt; 0.01), whereas catheter injury at 14 days induced a twofold increase (p &lt; 0.001) in the formation of intimal hyperplasia by 28 days. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated near-complete endothelial denudation after balloon catheter injury. In the 14- and 28-day control vein grafts, and in the balloon-injured vein grafts, the vascular surfaces had confluent endothelial linings. However, the ultrastructural features of the endothelial cells were group specific. Transmission electron microscopy of the same specimens confirmed this. There were no significant differences in contractility between the 28-day control and the catheter-injured vein grafts. This study demonstrates that balloon catheter injury doubles the rate at which intimal hyperplasia develops in vein grafts without significantly altering the physiologic phenotype of the smooth muscle cells as defined by their vasomotor function.<p>

BACKGROUND: It has been shown that suboptimal preparation of a vein graft prior to its insertion results in immediate morphological and functional damage to both endothelial cells and underlying smooth muscle cells. This study examines the influence of perioperative balloon catheter injury on the subsequent development of intimal hyperplasia and vasomotor function in experimental vein grafts. METHODS: Twenty New Zealand White rabbits had a carotid vein bypass graft performed: 10 were controls and 10 had a balloon catheter passed through their lumen which resulted in deendothelialization and intramural injury (4Fr Fogarty catheter, 0.6-0.75 ml H20 inflation, three passes). All grafts were harvested after 28 days for either morphology (n = 6) or functional studies (n = 4; four 5-mm rings/graft). RESULTS: Perioperative balloon injury of the vein graft resulted in a 23% increase in the intimal thickness (102 +/- 7 microm vs 83 +/- 2 microm, deendothelialized vs control; mean +/- SEM, P &lt; 0.01) and a 67% increase in medial thickness (144 +/- 19 microm vs 86 +/- 8 microm; mean +/- SEM, P &lt; 0.01) of the vein grafts. Both the sensitivity and maximal contraction of the responses elicited by norepinephrine, serotonin, and bradykinin were increased in the deendothelialized group compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Perioperative denuding balloon injury of the vein graft results in the increased development of intimal hyperplasia with an overall enhanced contractility. This study demonstrates the long-term structural and functional effects of perioperative balloon catheter injury on vein grafts that may contribute to decreased graft patency.<p>

OBJECTIVES: This study characterises pharmacologically the angiotensin II receptor in experimental vein grafts and examines the effect of the angiotensin II receptor (type 1) antagonist (L158,809) on the formation of vein graft intimal hyperplasia in vivo, as well as the in vitro physiological response to angiotensin II of vein grafts after chronic oral L158,809 treatment. MATERIALS: Thirty New Zealand White rabbits had a right carotid interposition bypass graft using the external jugular vein and were killed on the 28th postoperative day. DESIGN: To characterise the angiotensin II receptors, concentration response curves to angiotensin II were obtained in vitro in the presence or absence of L158,809. To determine the effect of L158,809 on the development of intimal hyperplasia, 10 animals received chronic oral therapy with L158,809 (10 mg/kg/day; begun 5 days before surgery and continued until harvest) and 10 animals received vehicle only as controls. These grafts were harvested either for histology (n = 6 per group) or for in vitro isometric tension studies to angiotensin II. RESULTS: The monophasic contractile response to angiotensin II in the untreated vein grafts could be inhibited in a concentration dependent manner by L158,809 with first order kinetics. Chronic oral treatment with L158,809 produced a 48% decrease in intimal thickness from 82 +/- 1 micron (mean +/- S.E.M.) in the controls to 43 +/- 7 microns in the treated vein grafts (p = 0.002). There was also a significant decrease (45%) in the medial thickness between the control (76 +/- 6 microns) and L158,809 treated (42 +/- 6 microns) vein grafts (p = 0.007). The responses to angiotensin II were abolished in the vein grafts by chronic L158,809 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that vein graft angiotensin II responses are mediated through a type 1 receptor and that chronic inhibition with L158,809, significantly reduces intimal hyperplasia and medial hypertrophy in experimental vein grafts and concomitantly abolishes the in vitro responses to angiotensin II. Therefore, angiotensin II acting through AT1 receptors mediates a significant part of the intimal hyperplastic response in vein grafts.<p>

High glucose concentrations lead to the formation of advanced glycosylation end-products (AGE). Increased glucose concentrations are found during the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and during coronary artery bypass surgery. This study examines the pharmacological effect of AGE on venous endothelial-dependent and -independent relaxation and seeks to determine if aminoguanidine, a known AGE inhibitor, can prevent changes induced by the presence of high glucose concentrations. Standard isometric tension studies on rings from endothelialized and deendothelialized rabbit external jugular veins were performed after incubation for 6 hr in 5.5 mM glucose (control) or 44 mM glucose. The effects of preincubation with either indomethacin (10 microM) to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase activity or aminoguanidine (10 microM) to inhibit protein glycosylation were also studied. In the presence of 44 mM glucose, there was a significant reduction in acetylcholine (endothelial cell based)- and forskolin-induced (smooth muscle cell based) relaxation without associated alterations in serotonin-, calcium ionophore-, and sodium nitroprusside-mediated relaxations. The alterations in acetylcholine-mediated relaxation were inhibited by the addition of indomethacin; co-incubation with aminoguanidine prevented the decrease in acetylcholine-mediated and forskolin-mediated responses. This study shows that in vitro elevated glucose concentrations lead to a reduction in both endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell relaxation, which may be due to AGE-mediated generation of endothelial cell cyclo-oxygenase products and AGE-induced changes in cAMP-mediated relaxation. Therefore, AGE production in the vessel wall cells produces alterations in receptor-dependent and receptor-independent cyclo-oxygenase production and these changes result in altered endothelial- and nonendothelial-mediated relaxation. Alterations in the endothelial and smooth muscle cell responses can be inhibited by aminoguanidine, suggesting that means to reduce or prevent glycosylation are beneficial in ameliorating the acute changes induced by short-term exposure to elevated glucose concentrations.<p>

Following vein grafting, responses in the arterial vein bypass grafts to angiotensin II, a known mitogen, increase. It is not known when these changes occur or whether these changes are due to alterations in endothelial cell function, excision/implantation of the vessel, or exposure to arterial hemodynamics. Two studies were designed to examine these questions. New Zealand White rabbits underwent excision of the external jugular vein, common carotid artery, an external jugular veno-venous bypass (VVG), or a common carotid veno-arterial bypass (VAG). Half the jugular veins and carotid arteries were mechanically denuded of their endothelium. All vein grafts were harvested at 28 days. A set of VAG was also harvested at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. Isometric tension studies to angiotensin II (10(-10) to 10(-4) M) were performed on rings from each jugular vein, carotid artery, and vein graft. Jugular veins had a triphasic response to angiotensin II. Deendothelialized jugular veins had a triphasic response with an increased first phase and a much reduced second phase. Carotid arteries (6.87 +/- 0.18 and 6.15 +/- 0.18; with and without endothelium; means +/- SEM, -log10[EC50); p &lt; .05), VVG (6.69 +/- 0.15), and VAG (7.42 +/- 0.29; p &lt; .05 compared to VVG) showed a monophasic response to angiotensin II at 28 days. This monophasic response in VAG to angiotensin II was recordable at 7 days postoperatively and there was no further change in its sensitivity between 14 and 28 days. These results suggest that the induction of altered angiotensin II responses is dependent on exposure to the arterial circulation, that alterations in VAG responses occur within the first 7 days of vein grafting, and that VAG at 28 days become more sensitive to angiotensin II than the carotid vessels into which they are placed. These changes in smooth muscle cell sensitivity to a known smooth muscle cell mitogen (angiotensin II) may contribute to the development of intimal hyperplasia in the veno-arterial graft.<p>

Davies, M. G., et al. (1996). &quot;Hypothermia and rewarming after hypothermic exposure alter venous relaxation.&quot; <u>Vascular Medicine</u> <b>1</b>(2): 103-107.<p>
Hypothermia has pathophysiological consequences on endothelial and smooth muscle cell function. This study investigates the impact on venous relaxation of hypothermia and rewarming following hypothermic exposure. In vitro isometric relaxation responses of norepinephrine precontracted rabbit external jugular veins to a panel of endothelium-dependent and -independent agonists were assessed in controls at 37 degrees C, and in an experimental group after cooling to 20 degrees C and after rewarming to 37 degrees C. On cooling, the endothelium-dependent responses to acetylcholine became multiphasic with initial contraction at low concentrations followed by relaxation at higher concentrations, the maximum of which was significantly diminished compared to controls. Incubation with indomethacin did not affect this response. Rewarming re-established a monophasic dose-dependent acetylcholine induced relaxation response but the maximal response was significantly augmented. This augmentation in relaxation on rewarming could be prevented by preincubation with indomethacin. The maximal response to calcium ionophore was reduced at 20 degrees C and augmented upon rewarming to 37 degrees C. All veins relaxed in a dose-dependent manner to the non-endothelium-dependent agonists forskolin and sodium nitroprusside; the maximal responses were significantly reduced at 20 degrees C and returned to normal upon rewarming. This study suggests that short-term exposure of venous tissue to hypothermia impairs the vessel's ability to produce endothelium-dependent relaxation. Rewarming does not re-establish normal endothelium-dependent relaxation but results in an enhanced, partially indomethacin-sensitive, response which appears to be independent of changes in non-endothelium-dependent mediated relaxation.<p>

The development of intimal hyperplasia in reversed vein grafts is associated with altered endothelial and vasomotor function. This study examines the effect of surgery on the morphology and vasomotor function of experimental arterial and venous vein bypass grafts. Twelve reversed vein grafts, 12 in situ vein grafts and 12 venovenous grafts were placed in 24 New Zealand White rabbits. All grafts remained patent and were harvested after 28 days. Isometric contraction to norepinephrine, histamine, bradykinin, serotonin and relaxation to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside following pre-contraction with prostaglandin F(2 alpha) were determined on the grafts and on contralateral jugular veins. Compared to the contralateral jugular veins, norepinephrine supersensitivity was induced in the reversed vein grafts, and venovenous vein grafts but not in the in situ vein grafts. Decrease in histamine sensitivity occurred in all grafted vessels. Bradykinin responses were significantly reduced in the in situ vein grafts and reversed vein grafts. Contractile responses to serotonin developed in the in situ vein grafts and reversed vein grafts only. Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxation of the contralateral jugular veins was preserved in both venovenous grafts and in situ vein grafts but was lost in reversed vein grafts. All tissues relaxed to sodium nitroprusside in dose-dependent manner. The data suggest that norepinephrine supersensitivity in reversed vein grafts results from excision of the vessel. Attenuation of bradykinin responses and the enhanced contractile responses to serotonin appear predominantly to result from arterialization. Decreases in histamine sensitivity appear related both to excision and to arterialization. Neither the excision of the vein nor arterialization individually influences the alterations in endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxation. However, a combination of excision and arterialization results in the altered endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxation. This study suggests that the surgical preparation of the vein and the surgical procedure used have significantly different effects on endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxation and smooth muscle contractility in vein grafts.<p>

PURPOSE: Vein grafts undergo morphologic and functional changes after insertion into the arterial circulation with the development of intimal hyperplasia, as well as significant alterations in endothelial and smooth muscle cell physiologic responses. METHODS: Forty New Zealand white rabbits underwent jugular vein interposition grafting of the common carotid artery. Ten animals were controls, 10 animals received 2.25% L-arginine supplementation in their drinking water (200 ml/day; 2 gm/kg) 7 days before surgery and continued thereafter until harvest, in 10 animals the veins were immersed in deferoxamine manganese (DFMn; 10(-3) mol/L in heparinized Ringer's lactate for 15 minutes) before implantation, and 10 received both L-arginine supplementation and either histologic (n=6) or isometric tension studies (n=4). The function of the vein grafts was compared with that of jugular veins. RESULTS: Treatment with DFMn, l-arginine, amd DFMn L-arginine produce increases in mean intimal thickness of 39% (51 +/ -7 microm; p&lt;0.05), 51% (41 +/- 7 microm; p&lt;0.05), and 65% (29 +/- 6 microm; p&lt; 0.01), respectively, compared with control vein grafts (83 +/- 12 microm). Compared with the control group, the intimal ratio ([intima]/[intima + media]) decreased by 16% (difference not significant), 8% (difference not significant), and 47% (p&lt;0.01) in the DFMn-, L-arginine- and and DFMn/L-arginine-treated vein grafts, respectively. Jugular veins relaxed to acetylcholine (53% +/- 12% maximal relaxation), whereas control vein grafts did not relax. In contrast, vein grafts from each of the experimental groups relaxed to acetylcholine with maximal relaxations of 26% +/- 7% (p&lt;0.05 compared with the jugular vein), 22% +/- 8% (p&lt;0.05), and 44% +/- 14% (difference not significant) in the DFMn, L-arginine, DFMn/L-arginine groups, respectively. Neither DFMn nor l-arginine had a significant effect on the alterations in smooth muscle contractility that occur in control vein grafts. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that an agent that modulates free radical production combined with a precursor of nitric oxide formation will lead to a significant decrease in the formation of intimal hyperplasia in arterial vein grafts with the preservation of endothelial-derived relaxation.<p>

Identification of all important community members as well as of the numerically dominant members of a community are key aspects of microbial community analysis of bioreactor samples. A systematic study was conducted with artificial consortia to test whether denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) is a reliable technique to obtain such community data under conditions where results would not be affected by differences in DNA extraction efficiency from cells. A total of 27 consortia were established by mixing DNA extracted from Escherichia coli K12, Burkholderia cepacia and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in different proportions. Concentrations of DNA of single organisms in the consortia were either 0.04, 0.4 or 4ng/microl. DGGE-PCR of genomic DNA with primer sets targeted at the V3 and V6-V8 regions of the 16S rDNA failed to detect the three community members in only 7% of consortia, but provided incorrect information about dominance or co-dominance for 85% and 89% of consortia with the primer sets for the V6-V8 and V3 regions, respectively. The high failure rate in detection of dominant B. cepacia with the primers for the V6-V8 region was attributable to a single nucleotide primer mismatch in the target sequences of both, the forward and reverse primer. Amplification bias in PCR of E. coli and S. maltophilia for the V6-V8 region and for all three organisms for the V3 region occurred due to interference of genomic DNA in PCR-DGGE, since a nested PCR approach, where PCR-DGGE was started from mixtures of 16S rRNA genes of the organisms, provided correct information about the relative abundance of original DNA in the sample. Multiple bands were not observed in pure culture amplicons produced with the V6-V8 primer pair, but pure culture V3 DGGE profiles of E. coli, S. maltophilia and B. cepacia contained 5, 3 and 3 bands, respectively. These results demonstrate DGGE was suitable for identification of all important community members in the three-membered artificial consortium, but not for identification of the dominant organisms in this small community. Multiple DGGE bands obtained for single organisms with the V3 primer pair could greatly confound interpretation of DGGE profiles.<p>

The lipid composition of biological membranes is key for cell viability. Nevertheless, and despite their central role in cell function, our understanding of membrane physiology continues to lag behind most other aspects of cell biology. The maintenance of membrane properties in situations of environmental stress requires homeostatic sense-and-response mechanisms. For example, the balance between esterified saturated (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), is a key factor determining lipid packing, water permeability, and membrane fluidity. The reduced thermal motion of lipid acyl chains triggered by an increase in SFAs causes a tighter lipid packing and increase the membrane viscosity. Conversely almost all organisms adapt to membrane rigidifying conditions, such as low temperature in poikilotherms, by incorporating more lipids with poorly packing unsaturated acyl chains. The molecular mechanisms underlying membrane homeostasis are only starting to emerge through combinations of genetics, cell biology, lipidomics, structural approaches and computational modelling. In this review we discuss recent advances in defining molecular machineries responsible for sensing membrane properties and mediating homeostatic responses in bacteria, yeast and animals. Although these organisms use remarkably distinct sensing mechanisms to mediate membrane adaptation, they suggest that the principle of transmembrane signaling to integrate membrane composition with lipid biosynthesis is ancient and essential for life.<p>

The oxygen-binding behavior of the 24-meric hemocyanin of the scorpion Pandinus imperator and its dependence on allosteric effectors such as protons can be successfully described by the nesting model; the MWC model is not acceptable. The affinities of the four assumed conformations of the allosteric unit, the 12-meric half-molecule, are not dependent on pH whereas the three allosteric equilibrium constants decrease with decreasing proton concentration. Comparison with the oxygen-binding behavior of the 24-meric tarantula hemocyanin (Eurypelma californicum) reveals that the affinity values for the various conformations seem to be conserved for chelicerata hemocyanin.<p>

Continuous oxygen binding curves for two arthropodan hemocyanins were performed at different pH values ranging from 7.0 to 8.7 and in the presence of physiological concentrations of the bivalent ions Ca2+ and Mg2+. The arthropods Eurypelma californicum and Homarus americanus are classified as chelicerata and crustaceans, respectively. Their structurally well-characterized hemocyanins are composed of, in the case of E. californicum 24 subunits, and in the case of H. americanus 12 subunits. The role of protons as allosteric effectors of the oxygen binding was analysed in terms of the nesting model, which assumes hierarchies of allosteric equilibria that are based on obvious structural hierarchies. For each hemocyanin, the smallest structural repeating unit, the 12-mer or the 6-mer, respectively, was regarded as the &quot;allosteric unit&quot;. Two allosteric units are allosterically coupled within the native molecules. The analysis revealed that in accordance with the postulations of the classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux model protons as allosteric effectors do not change the oxygen affinities of the four postulated conformations, but influence the allosteric equilibria between them at two different hierarchical levels. Model-independent determination of the affinity constants for the binding of the first and the last oxygen molecule to the native hemocyanins and to the isolated half-molecules confirmed the affinities calculated according to the nesting model. The stepwise establishment of new conformations during the assembly process from monomers to the structurally identical repeating unit and further on to the native molecule is shown. Possible physiological advantages of allosterically coupled allosteric units in contrast to allosterically uncoupled ones are thought to be (1) the option to regulate oxygen binding on different levels of structural hierarchy and (2) the increase of the oxygen-carrying capacity.<p>

We describe the clinical and echocardiographic findings in eight patients with right atrial spontaneous echo contrast who were identified from 648 consecutive patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. Common findings in these patients were right atrial enlargement (8 patients), tricuspid regurgitation (7 patients), atrial fibrillation or flutter (6 patients), elevated right ventricular pressure (5 patients), moderate or severe mitral valve disease (5 patients), and right to left interatrial shunts (3 patients). Right heart catheterization in three patients showed markedly elevated right atrial, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery pressures. Two patients had thromboembolic events-one patient had recurrent pulmonary emboli, and another patient with an atrial septal aneurysm had recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Right atrial echo contrast is an uncommon finding at echocardiography that is associated with severe right heart dysfunction. It may also be associated with paradoxical or pulmonary embolism.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of a new system designed to reduce heparin-protamine mismatch on bleeding after open heart surgery. DESIGN: Nonrandomized but consecutive retrospective review of patients undergoing open heart surgery during a 9-month period. SETTING: Multispecialty referral center. PATIENTS: A total of 150 patients comparable by age, body surface area, and coagulation status undergoing primary open heart surgery for either coronary bypass or heart valve replacement. INTERVENTION: In the first 75 patients (group 1), heparin sodium was neutralized with protamine sulfate, using a fixed ratio (1 mg of heparin sodium to 1.3 mg of protamine sulfate). An activated clotting time was used to confirm heparin neutralization. For the subsequent 75 patients (group 2), titration of heparin and protamine from defined lots was accomplished using activated clotting times adjusted and matched to drug lots to minimize biologic variability. Groups 1 and 2 had comparable operations, pump times, and cross-clamp times. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Doses of heparin and protamine and their effect on blood product transfusion and postoperative bleeding were evaluated in all patients. RESULTS: The average protamine sulfate dose for group 2 patients (287.56 +/- 8.3 mg) was significantly lower than that for group 1 (346.01 +/- 12.6 mg) (P &lt; .0005). Less protamine was associated with the transfusion of fewer red blood cells (0.92 +/- 0.15 vs 2.57 +/- 0.38 U) (P &lt; .001), platelets (0.72 +/- 0.8 vs 2.96 +/- 0.80 U) (P &lt; .01), and fresh-frozen plasma (0.83 +/- 2.0 vs 2.01 +/- 0.48 U) (P &lt; .03). No patients in group 2 required reexploration for bleeding, compared with eight patients in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in protamine dose was associated with significant decreases in blood product use and postoperative bleeding. Excess protamine warrants consideration as both an important and a controllable factor in coagulopathy after open heart surgery.<p>

The mortality of the primary leiomyosarcoma of the bone is 50%, the mean survival time after diagnosis is 3.4 years. Diagnosis of a primary leiomyosarcoma of the bone is only possible after a secondary leiomyosarcoma has been excluded as well as by histopathological including immunohistochemical examination. The operative procedure is the therapy of choice. A neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant radio- or chemotherapy can be useful.<p>

With computer simulations of self-motion, Ss controlled their altitude as they approached a floating object and, after getting as close as possible to the object, tried to &quot;jump&quot; over it without collision. Ss jumped significantly later for small objects, compared with larger objects that were approached from equal distances at equal speeds and were positioned at equal clearance heights. This occurred even when accretion-deletion information was present and when object width and length were varied independently. Results were consistent with studies in which Ss judged a large far approaching object to hit the viewpoint before a small near object that would have arrived sooner (P.R. DeLucia, 1991a, 1991b). Results suggest that pictorial information such as relative size contributes to active collision-avoidance tasks and must be considered in models of perceived distance and time-to-arrival.<p>

Empathy is a multidimensional construct composed of several components such as emotion recognition, emotional perspective taking and affective responsiveness. Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits in several domains of emotion processing and perspective taking, thus suggesting a dysfunctional emotional competence. We assessed empathic abilities via three paradigms measuring emotion recognition, perspective taking and affective responsiveness as well as self-report empathy questionnaires in 24 (12 females, 12 males) schizophrenia patients meeting the DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 24 matched healthy volunteers. Patients were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, RWTH Aachen University and healthy volunteers were recruited via advertisement. Groups were matched for age, gender and parental education. Data analysis indicates a significant empathic deficit in patients, reflected in worse performance in all three domains. This deficit was only partly reflected in the self-report empathy questionnaires. Comparing the different tasks, emotional perspective taking was the most difficult task for all subjects and symptomatology worsened affective responsiveness. Schizophrenia patients not only struggle to correctly identify emotions, but also have difficulties in spontaneously simulating another person's subjective world (perspective taking) and might not be able to respond adequately in terms of their own emotional experience (affective responsiveness), which are not caused by emotion perception deficits. The results suggest that all domains of empathy are affected in schizophrenia and have to be addressed independently in behavioral therapies, thereby offering a possibility to improve socio-occupational life.<p>

This study examined the effects of different exercise training programs on androgen receptor content and receptor affinity to dihydrotestosterone in fast glycolytic (FG) and slow oxidative (SO) skeletal muscle fibers in rats. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into three groups: control, endurance exercise trained and resistance exercise trained. After the exercise programs were completed, the extensor digitorum longus (EDL), predominantly a FG muscle, and the soleus, predominantly a SO muscle, were isolated, weighted and both androgen receptor content and affinity to dihydrotestosterone were determined. Resistance training evoked a significant (P &lt; 0.05) hypertrophic response in the soleus but not the EDL. Endurance training was not associated with any significant hypertrophy in either the soleus or the EDL. Neither the endurance nor the resistance training program resulted in changes in androgen receptor affinity to dihydrotestosterone. However, alterations in androgen receptor content were noted. The endurance training program resulted in a significant increase in androgen receptor content in the soleus, but no significant difference in the EDL. The resistance training program elicited a significant decrease in androgen receptor content in the soleus, and a significant increase in the EDL. These results indicate that different exercise stimuli induce changes in androgen receptor content that are specific to skeletal muscle fiber type.<p>

We report here the isolation of three members of a new family of antimicrobial peptides from the hemolymph of shrimps Penaeus vannamei in which immune response has not been experimentally induced. The three molecules display antimicrobial activity against fungi and bacteria with a predominant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The complete sequences of these peptides were determined by a combination of enzymatic cleavages, Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, and cDNA cloning using a hemocyte cDNA library. The mature molecules (50 and 62 residues) are characterized by an NH2-terminal domain rich in proline residues and a COOH-terminal domain containing three intramolecular disulfide bridges. One of these molecules is post-translationally modified by a pyroglutamic acid at the first position. Comparison of the data obtained from the cDNA clones and mass spectrometry showed that two of these peptides are probably COOH-terminally amidated by elimination of a glycine residue. These molecules with no evident homology to other hitherto described antimicrobial peptides were named penaeidins.<p>

We report here the isolation from plasma of two penaeid shrimp species of novel peptides/polypeptides with exclusive antifungal activities. A set of three molecules was purified with molecular masses at 2.7 kDa (Penaeus vannamei), 7.9 kDa, and 8.3 kDa (Penaeus stylirostris). Primary structure determination was performed by a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. The peptides display 95-100% sequence identity with a C-terminal sequence of hemocyanin, indicating that they are cleaved fragments of the shrimp respiratory protein. Specific immunodetection of the hemocyanin-derived (poly)peptides revealed that experimental microbial infections increase their relative concentration in plasma as compared with nonstimulated animals. Thus, the production of antifungal (poly)peptides by limited proteolysis of hemocyanin could be relevant to a shrimp immune reaction that would confer a new function to the multifunctional respiratory pigment of crustaceans.<p>

Night vision goggles (NVG) operations are characterized as stressful with high task loading. Any reduction in goggle or visual performance which goes undetected can have a serious effect on flight safety and operational capability. The NVG Test Lane, with its resolution chart, provides an effective cost-efficient method for aircrew members to quickly evaluate the correct positioning and focusing of their NVG's prior to each mission. This evaluation validated the ability of the NVG resolution chart to produce the same performance results as a more detailed psychophysical procedure. NVG visual acuity was measured for five subjects (four pilots and one non-pilot) with two different night vision goggles. The results supported that there is no statistical difference between the results obtained with the individual target format and the 3 x 3 format. Additionally, the pilots with current NVG experience were able to obtain a significantly better acuity level than were those without current NVG experience.<p>

Night operations involve diverse mission areas and require an increased reliance on the use of night vision devices, such as night vision goggles (NVG's). Any reduction in goggle or visual performance which goes undetected can have a serious effect on flight safety and operational capability. Under controlled lighting conditions, a crewmember should be able to obtain the best possible goggle performance, and to determine if the goggle is functioning properly. These data represent a sample of 218 current USAF aircrew members representing all crew positions in both rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. Three measurements of goggle performance, expressed as NVG visual acuity, were obtained. The first measure, obtained after crewmembers adjusted the goggles with their usual adjustment methods, showed that they routinely obtain less than optimal acuity levels; i.e., averaging between 20/50 and 20/55. The second measure, taken when the NVG Resolution Chart was provided to augment their &quot;usual&quot; method of adjustment, showed improved performance; i.e., averaging 20/45. The third measure, taken following participation in an NVG Adjustment Procedures class, showed the greatest improvement, averaging between 20/35 and 20/40. In summary, it is reasonable to conclude that aircrew members who are able to obtain the best possible performance for their NVG's under controlled preflight conditions will obtain the best possible goggle performance under the widely varying flight conditions.<p>

Vitellogenin (Vg), the hemolymph precursor to the major yolk protein in mosquitoes, is synthesized in the fat body of blood-fed females. Mosquito Vg consists of two subunits with Mr = 200,000 and 66,000. Here, we demonstrate that both the Vg subunits are first synthesized as a single precursor. The identity of this Vg precursor was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies. In cell-free translation of fat body poly (A)+ RNA, the Vg precursor had Mr = 224,000 which increased to 240,000 in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. A precursor with Mr = 250,000 was immunoprecipitated in microsomal fractions isolated from rat bodies. With in vitro pulse labeling, the 250-kDa precursor could be detected in homogenates of fat bodies from blood-fed mosquitoes only during the first few hours accumulation of the Vg precursor was achieved by an in vitro stimulation of Vg synthesis in previtellogenic fat bodies cultured with an insect hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone. The 250-kDa precursor was glycosylated and to a much lesser degree phosphorylated. Treatment of fat bodies with tunicamycin yielded the precursor with Mr = 226,000 which was neither glycosylated nor phosphorylated. The reduction in molecular mass of the 250-kDa Vg precursor and of both mature Vg subunits combined was similar after digestion with endoglycosidase H, indicating that glycosylation is completed prior to cleavage of the Vg precursor. In vitro pulse-chase experiments revealed rapid proteolytic cleavage of the 250-kDa precursor to two polypeptides with Mr = 190,000 and 62,000 which transformed into mature Vg subunits of 200- and 66-kDa as the last step prior to Vg secretion. This last step in Vg processing was inhibited by an ionophore, monensin, and therefore occurred in the Golgi complex. Sulfation as an additional, previously unknown, modification of mosquito Vg was revealed by the incorporation of sodium [35S]sulfate into both Vg subunits. Since sulfation of Vg was predominantly blocked by monensin, the final maturation of Vg subunits in the Golgi complex is, at least in part, due to this modification.<p>

Human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) are a promising source to treat various neurodegenerative diseases. Potential applications are to use such cells for reprogramming to induce pluripotent stem cells or for secretion of proteins into the brain. These applications usually involve expression of heterologously expressed genes which is difficult to achieve in hNPCs. We tested several protocols for non-viral gene transfer and different promoters. Nucleofection and the cytomegalovirus enhancer/chicken beta-actin promoter allowed expression of foreign genes in hNPCs for up to 6 months. Treatment with the antibiotic G418 enabled us to select stably transfected cells which were subcloned and continued to express the NPC marker nestin. Differentiation of stably nucleofected hNPCs revealed that multipotency was maintained following long-term expansion of subcloned hNPCs. After differentiation for 3 weeks in vitro or in vivo following striatal transplantations transfected hNPCs expressed voltage-gated sodium channels suggesting the development of functional properties during neuronal maturation. In conclusion, stably nucleofected hNPCs can be isolated, subcloned, and expanded for up to 6 months without loss of their differentiation potential. These data provide a basis for future studies using hNPCs to investigate the neuronal differentiation in vivo after transplantation, the feasibility as a vector for gene (protein) therapy, and the induction of pluripotent stem cells.<p>

A prospective multicenter phase-II trial (12 centers) was performed by the German larynx organ preservation group (DeLOS) to evaluate the effect of induction chemotherapy (ICHT) with paclitaxel/cisplatin (TP), followed by accelerated-hyperfractionated (concomitant boost) radiotherapy (RT) in responders. The trial was focused on larynx preservation, tumor control, survival, salvage surgery and late toxicity in patients with advanced larynx/hypopharynx carcinoma eligible for total laryngectomy (LE). Seventy-one patients (40 larynx, 87.5% St. III, IV; 31 hypopharynx, 93.4% St. III, IV) were enrolled into the study and treated with ICHT (200 mg/m(2) paclitaxel, 100 mg/m(2) cisplatin; day 1, 22) according to the DeLOS protocol. Patients with complete or partial tumor response proceeded to RT (69.9 Gy in 5.5 weeks). Non-responders received a LE followed by postoperative RT (56-70 Gy in 5.5-7 weeks). The response rate to ICHT for larynx cancer was 69.6% (7.1% complete, 62.5% partial response) and for hypopharyngeal cancer was 84.3% (6.9% complete, 77.4% partial response). Overall survival after 36 months was 60.3% (95% CI, 48.4-72.2%), after 42 months was 56.5% (95% CI, 44.2-68.8%). Laryngectomy-free survival was as follows: after 36 months, 43.0% (95% CI, 30.9-55.0%); after 42 months, 41.3% (95% CI, 29.3-53.3%). Both parameters did not show different outcomes after distinguishing larynx from hypopharynx. LE was indicated in 15 non-responders after ICHT. Five of the 15 non-responders refused the laryngectomy. Two of the five received RT instead and had no evidence of disease 42 months after RT. Late toxicity (dysphagia III, IV LENT SOMA score in laryngectomy-free survivors: after 6 months, 1.8%; 12 months, 11.4%; 18 months, 14.5%; 24 months, 8.1%; 36 months, 16%) and salvage surgery (4 pharyngocutaneous fistulas in 27 operations) were tolerable. In a large portion of patients eligible for LE, the larynx could be preserved with satisfying functional outcome. Good responders after ICHT had also a good general outcome with relatively rare severe late toxicities. Due to a slight increase of relevant late dysphagia, functional outcome regarding swallowing and tracheotomy free breathing should be more focused in future larynx organ preservation trials.<p>

We examined the immune response of a fly as physicians might, by looking at the genesis of diseases caused by microorganisms. Fly infections are complex and there are few simple rules that can predict how an infected fly might fare. As we observed the finer details of the infections, we found that almost every microbe caused a different type of pathology in the fly. Two pattern recognition pathways, Toll and immune deficiency (Imd), were found to detect, and respond to, infections. The physiological response of the fly was modified further by Eiger, insulin, Wnt inhibitor of dorsal (WntD) and nitric oxide (NO) signaling. As in humans, some of the damage that occurred during the fly immune response was caused by an over-aggressive response rather than by the microbes themselves. When looking at the matrix of signaling pathways and the microbes being tested, it was immediately obvious that most of the pathways would need to be studied in more detail before defining the rules that govern their role in pathogenesis. This detailed analysis of signaling and pathogenesis has the potential to allow the fly to be used as a model patient instead of as simply an innate immune system model.<p>

This investigation extended prior work by determining if stress and body mass index (BMI) contributed independently to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels among prepubescent Latino children and if sex and family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) modified these relationships. Data were collected in South Florida from 112 nondiabetic school-aged Hispanic children, of whom 43.8% were obese (BMI &gt;/= 95th percentile) and 51.8% presented with a family history of T2DM. Stressful life events were assessed via parental report using a life events scale. Plasma TNF-alpha levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relative contributions of stress and BMI with TNF-alpha levels and the potential interaction effects of sex and family history of T2DM were analyzed with multiple linear regression analyses. Stress and BMI each accounted for a significant proportion of the unique variance associated with TNF-alpha. The association between stress and TNF-alpha was not modified by sex or family history of T2DM. These findings implicate BMI and stress as independent determinants of TNF-alpha (an inflammatory cytokine and adipocytokine) among Latino children. Future investigations should examine the potential roles of exercise, nutritional status, age, and growth hormone in explicating the relationship between TNF-alpha production and psychosocial distress and risk for infection among obese children.<p>

To evaluate dual-phase multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) in the detection of intestinal bleeding using an experimental bowel model and varying bleeding velocities. The model consisted of a high pressure injector tube with a single perforation (1 mm) placed in 10-m-long small bowel of a pig. The bowel was filled with water/contrast solution of 30-40 HU and was incorporated in a phantom model containing vegetable oil to simulate mesenteric fat. Intestinal bleeding in different locations and bleeding velocities varying from zero to 1 ml/min (0.05 ml/min increments, constant bleeding duration of 20 s) was simulated. Nineteen complete datasets in arterial and portal-venous phase using increasing bleeding velocities, and seven negative controls were measured using a 64 MDCT (3-mm slice thickness, 1.5-mm reconstruction increment). Three radiologists blinded to the experimental settings evaluated the datasets in a random order. The likelihood for intestinal bleeding was assessed using a 5-point scale with subsequent ROC analysis. The sensitivity to detect bleeding was 0.44 for a bleeding velocity of 0.10-0.50 ml/min and 0.97 for 0.55-1.00 ml/min. The specificity was 1.00. The area under the curve was calculated to be 0.73, 0.88 and 0.89 for reader 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Dual-phase MDCT provides high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of intestinal bleeding with bleeding velocities of 0.5-1.0 ml/min. Therefore, MDCT should be considered as a primary diagnostic technique in the management of patients with suspected intestinal bleeding.<p>

Mergers and acquisitions, multibillion dollar profit margins, and hospital chains that boast more than 400 sites all reflect the fact that health care is no longer a cottage industry but a corporate giant. The forms and structures that will provide care will continue to disintegrate and then evolve as we face a crisis in Medicare funding and as the ranks of uninsured continue to grow. The challenge for nursing leaders to stay centered on the core product and the core process of our industry--caring for patients. Integration is the key strategy that must be applied to achieve that end. We must strive for integration in three levels: within ourselves, between persons, and within our organization. Only then will nursing leadership be able to bring wholeness and influence to the corporate health care world through our individual roles and collectively through our profession.<p>

The levels of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were determined in 8 passive air samples (PAS) and 6 lichen transplants (Ramalina fastigiata) deployed for a period of 2 months in different zones of Tarragona County (Catalonia, Spain), an area with an important number of chemical and petrochemical industries. The accumulated amount of the sum of the 16 PAHs ranged between 1363 to 7866 ng/sample in air samples. The highest concentration was found in the neighborhood of Puigdelfi (village of Perafort), in the vicinity of a big oil refinery and well under the potential influence of the petrochemical emissions. In lichen samples, the sum of the 16 PAHs ranged between 247 and 841 ng/g (dry weight), being the greatest value also observed in Puigdelfi. Data on the levels and profiles of PAHs in both passive monitoring methods were compared. A significant positive linear correlation was found between the concentrations of low molecular weight PAHs in lichens and the amounts accumulated in passive air samples (R = 0.827, P &lt; 0.05), being especially significant the correlation of 4-ring PAHs (R = 0.941, P &lt; 0.05). These results strongly suggest that lichens can be used to monitor gas-phase PAHs, providing data that can be quantitatively translated into equivalents for air.<p>

The juvenile hormone analog (JHA) methoprene was used to induce the synthesis of the yolk protein precursor vitellogenin (Vg) in adult females and males of the cockroach Leucophaea maderae. The female- and male-produced vitellogenin (VgF and VgM, respectively) contained polypeptides of 112, 95, 92, and 54 kDa. Also present in the secreted vitellogenins was a soffmall quantity of a short-lived transitional 155 kDa Vg polypeptide, and a variable amount of an 85 dDa species. Quantitatively, the VgF and VgM were significantly different in the Vg112 and Vg95 units (VgF &gt; VgM), and in the Vg85 polypeptide (VgF &lt; VgM). In the present study, the biosynthesis of Vg precursors in the fat bodies of females and males was examined using a short radiopulse with 35S-methionine/cysteine and 32P-orthophosphate. The glycosylation of the Vg precursors was examined by digestion with endoglycosidase H and by the inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin. The data showed that in both females and males, the synthesis of the vitellogenin precursor occurred in a stepwise fashion: (1) the co-translational glycosylation of Vg203; (2) the post-translational phosphorylation of Vg203 to form Vg220; (3) the proteolytic processing of Vg220 to form the constituent Vg polypeptides. The 203 and 220 kDa Vg precursors of females and males appeared to be similarly glycosylated and phosphorylated. The additional processing of Vg112 to Vg85 was more pronounced in the fat bodies of males than in females, and appears to account for the quantitative difference in the distribution of these polypeptides in VgF and VgM. Finally, the major oligosaccharides of VgF and VgM appear to be those of N-linked mannose residues. The treatment of females and males with tunicamycin indicated that the co-translational glycosylation of Vg precursors was required for the phosphorylation of the Vg precursor, as well as the secretion of Vg from the fat body.<p>

The role of thrombolysis, left ventricular function, and Holter ST-segment depression in modulating VPC frequency is unclear. In a placebo-controlled, randomized study of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in 103 patients with AMI (Tissue Plasminogen Activator: Toronto study), VPC frequency and ST depression on Holter monitoring (day 7), ejection fraction by radionuclide scan (day 9), and infarct artery patency and cross-sectional area on day 1 (n = 42) were assessed. After administering t-PA, VPC frequency was 10 +/- 58/hour (mean +/- SD), similar to that after placebo (23.5 +/- 91.7, p = NS). However, patients with ST depression had greater VPC frequency (56 +/- 140/hour) than those without it (1.3 +/- 2.6/hour, p = 0.05). Ejection fraction was negatively correlated with VPC frequency (r = -0.33, p &lt; 0.001). By multivariate analysis, ejection fraction (F = 7.0, p &lt; 0.01) and ST depression (F = 5.8, p &lt; 0.02) were the only independent predictors of VPC frequency. In this placebo-controlled study, VPC frequency after AMI was not related to thrombolytic administration but was associated with ST depression and ejection fraction. This suggests that the underlying extent of both infarcted and ischemic myocardium is important in modulating ventricular arrhythmias after AMI.<p>

Duarte, B. F., et al. (2019). &quot;Effect of temperature on survival and cuticular composition of three different ant species.&quot; <u>Journal of Thermal Biology</u> <b>80</b>: 178-189.<p>
Climatic factors, such as temperature variation, interfere with the survival of insects. To respond to these variations, insects have some specific characteristics. These include water content of the body, thickness of the lipid layer, as well as the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of cuticular chemical components. This study hypothesizes that different ant species respond to temperature changes in different ways and that such differences may be associated with cuticle hydrocarbons (CHCs) and fatty acids. As model ant species, Atta sexdens, Odontomachus bauri and Ectatomma brunneum were used for experimental analyses. Ants were submitted to a water bath for 5h at different temperatures, and their CHCs and fatty acids were identified and quantified, followed by correlating these chemical compounds with temperature variations and the survival. Temperatures below 30 degrees C did not affect the survival of the three species. E. brunneum had a higher percentage of survival at temperatures above 30 degrees C. O. bauri was the most sensitive species with 100% mortality at 40 degrees C. Survival was found to be unrelated to any of the identified fatty acids. However, CHCs underwent significant quantitative and qualitative variation, as shown by an increased percentage of CHCs with longer chain length of linear alkanes at temperatures above 30 degrees C. These increase enables these ants to maintain the integrity of their cuticle and survive at temperatures above 30 degrees C. It can be concluded that the forager ants studied respond differently to temperature variation and that changes in the conformation of CHCs are in line with the ecological characteristics of the different studied species because, they vary in terms of diurnal/nocturnal foraging and types of environments foraged. Among the three species, E. brunneum foragers were found to be more active under adverse conditions and more tolerant to temperature variation with the correspondingly appropriate changes in CHCs composition.<p>

Temperature can modify membrane fluidity and thus affects cellular functions and physiological activities. This study examines lipid remodelling in the marine symbiotic organism, Tridacna maxima, during a time series of induced thermal stress, with an emphasis on the morphology of their symbiont Symbiodinium First, we show that the French Polynesian giant clams harbour an important proportion of saturated fatty acids (SFA), which reflects their tropical location. Second, in contrast to most marine organisms, the total lipid content in giant clams remained constant under stress, though some changes in their composition were shown. Third, the stress-induced changes in fatty acid (FA) diversity were accompanied by an upregulation of genes involved in lipids and ROS pathways. Finally, our microscopic analysis revealed that for the giant clam's symbiont, Symbiodinium, thermal stress led to two sequential cell death processes. Our data suggests that the degradation of Symbiodinium cells could provide an additional source of energy to T maxima in response to heat stress.<p>

As for other vascular plants, numerous adaptive strategies have been selected in epiphytic ferns in order to survive in a constraining and desiccating environment and thus to prevent dehydration and/or to access to water and nutrients. Here we present some of the specializations that allow ferns to survive in this particular habitat. Some of the most spectacular epiphytic specializations are observed in the Polypodiaceae family, involving humus-collectors which entrap humus in specialized organs, and ant-plant mutualism strategies. We then address the question of epiphytism in an evolutionary context. There is little fossil evidence of vascular epiphytes. Inferring the evolution of epiphytism in extant ferns shows that diversification of major living epiphytic groups mostly occurred in the Tertiary. Finally, we focus on the Hymenophyllaceae family which provides an original example of hygrophilous epiphytic strategy that is unique in vascular plants.<p>

Plasma levels of D-dimer have been found useful as a marker of deep venous thrombosis in those patients in whom thrombosis is suspected, but their usefulness in postoperative screening is less clear. We have investigated the relationship of D-dimer to deep venous thrombosis in 90 patients after total hip and knee arthroplasty. From the first postoperative day the D-dimer levels were found to be highly significantly raised in patients with deep venous thrombosis. A combined result over the first six postoperative days in excess of 1200 ng/ml correlated with thrombosis with a specificity of 100%, sensitivity of 45%, positive predictive value of 60%, and negative predictive value of 100%. However, individual estimations were not discriminatory.<p>

How do cartilaginous elements attain their characteristic size and shape? Two intimately coupled processes underlie the patterned growth of cartilage. The first is histogenesis, which entails the production of cartilage as a discrete tissue; the second is morphogenesis, which pertains to the origins of three-dimensional form. Histogenesis relies on cues that promote the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells, whereas morphogenesis requires information that imbues cartilage with stage-specific (e.g. embryonic versus adult), region-specific (e.g. cranial versus appendicular) and species-specific size and shape. Previous experiments indicate that early programmatic events and subsequent signaling interactions enable chondrogenic mesenchyme to undergo histogenesis and morphogenesis, but precise molecular and cellular mechanisms that generate cartilage size and shape remain unclear. In the face and jaws, neural crest-derived mesenchyme clearly plays an important role, given that this embryonic population serves as the source of chondrocytes and of species-specific patterning information. To elucidate mechanisms through which neural crest-derived mesenchyme affects cartilage size and shape, we made chimeras using quail and duck embryos, which differ markedly in their craniofacial anatomy and rates of maturation. Transplanting neural crest cells from quail to duck demonstrates that mesenchyme imparts both stage-specific and species-specific size and shape to cartilage by controlling the timing of preceding and requisite molecular and histogenic events. In particular, we find that mesenchyme regulates FGF signaling and the expression of downstream effectors such as sox9 and col2a1. The capacity of neural crest-derived mesenchyme to orchestrate spatiotemporal programs for chondrogenesis autonomously, and to implement cartilage size and shape across embryonic stages and between species simultaneously, provides a novel mechanism linking ontogeny and phylogeny.<p>

The concept of the morphogenetic field has been used extensively in developmental biology. However, little is known about the mechanisms that partition these broad areas of tissue into the smaller areas which actually form the corresponding structures, and the remaining tissue. In the Mexican axolotl, the heart field forms as the anterior lateral plate mesoderm migrates over the underlying pharyngeal endoderm between stages 14 and 28. We have previously shown that both the mid-ventral and lateral walls of the pharyngeal cavity have considerable inductive capacity at stage 14. If this inductive capability, and the competence of the mesoderm to respond, is retained between stages 14 and 28, a much broader area of mesoderm would be induced than actually participates in heart development. In this paper, we use explant cultures to establish that pharyngeal endoderm retains its inductive activity, and that both pre-cardiac mesoderm and lateral plate mesoderm caudal to the pharyngeal cavity remain competent to respond to the induction throughout this period. We also map the specified region of the antero-lateral mesoderm between stages 14 and 28 by placing carefully measured areas of mesoderm in culture without inductive endoderm. We found that the region capable of initiating a spontaneous beat approximately doubles in size during this period. Since the specified region is larger than the actual heart primordium, some mechanism must exist to partition &quot;induced&quot; mesoderm into heart-forming and non-heart-forming areas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

The peptidomimetic thrombin inhibitor CRC 220, 4-methoxy-2,3,6-trimethylphenylsulfonyl-L-aspartyl-D-4-amidinop henylalanyl- piperidide, is taken up into isolated rat hepatocytes through active, carrier-mediated transport. This uptake is inhibited by bile acids. Functional expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes was performed to identify the transport system responsible for the hepatocellular CRC 220 uptake. Injection of poly(A)+RNA in X. laevis oocytes resulted in a two- to three-times higher uptake of CRC 220, compared with uninjected or water-injected control oocytes. Taurocholate (200 mumol/L) inhibited this uptake completely. No uptake of the peptidomimetic thrombin inhibitor was observed, when X. laevis oocytes were injected with complementary RNA (cRNA) encoding either the cloned rat liver Na(+)-dependent taurocholate transporter Ntcp, the renal oligopeptide carrier rhaPT or the intestinal oligopeptide transporter PepT1. However, after injection of cRNA of the cloned rat liver Na(+)-independent organic anion transporting polypeptide oatp, a specific and saturable CRC 220 uptake was observed (Michaelis-Menten constant 29.5 mumol/L). Cis-inhibition with known oatp-substrates, e.g., 20 mumol/L Bromsulphalein (BSP), 2007 mumol/L taurocholate and 2007 mumol/L cholate, occurred in oatp-expressing X. laevis oocytes, whereas substrates of the two peptide carriers as well as dipeptide- and single-amino acid constituents of the thrombin inhibitor itself lacked any significant inhibitory effects. These data show that the modified dipeptide CRC 220 is a highly selective substrate of the organic anion transporting polypeptide oatp in the basolateral plasma membrane of rat hepatocytes.<p>

Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (Cdh) has been anaerobically purified from Methanosarcina frisia Go1. The enzyme is a Ni2+-, Fe2+-, and S2--containing alpha2beta2 heterotetramer of 214 kDa with a pI of 5.2 and subunits of 94 and 19 kDa. It has a Vmax of 0.3 mmol of CO min-1 mg-1 and Km values for CO and methyl viologen of approximately 0.9 mM and 0.12 mM, respectively. EPR spectroscopy on the reduced enzyme showed two overlapping signals: one indicative for 2 (4Fe-4S)+ clusters and a second signal that is atypical for standard Fe/S clusters. The latter was, together with high-spin EPR signals of the oxidized enzyme tentatively assigned to an Fe/S cluster of high nuclearity.<p>

In a prospective study 150 adult patients with mandible fractures were analysed. Criteria for entry into the study were fractures of the mandibular body with and without associated condylar fractures. The fractures must fit to the Spiessl-classes F1 and F2, L1 to L4, W0 to W3 and the patients must have had a sufficient dentition to judge their occlusion. Not included were patients with combinations of mandible and Le Fort fractures, comminuted and defect fractures and patients who could not communicate preoperatively in order to have a full preoperative examination. The patients were equally distributed among 3 different treatment groups. Group 1 was treated conservatively with MMF, only displaced fractures which needed open reduction were internally fixed with wire osteosynthesis. Group 2 received rigid internal fixation with AO 2.7-plates from an intraoral approach, group 3 internal fixation with miniadaption-plates also from an intraoral approach. Using a standardized treatment protocol the patients were followed in defined intervals up to a maximum of 2 years after therapy. Group 1 presented with the lowest complication rate, group 2 with the highest rate of overall complications as far as disturbances of the occlusion and sensory disturbances were concerned. Except one plate fracture in group 3 with subsequent pseudarthrosis, which required a reosteosynthesis with a rigid plate, no major complications in bone healing were observed.<p>

We have isolated, from the hemolymph of unchallenged scorpions of the species Androctonus australis, three distinct antimicrobial peptides, which we have fully characterized by Edman degradation, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Two are novel molecules: (i) androctonin, a 25-residue peptide with two disulfide bridges, active against both bacteria (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) and fungi and showing marked sequence homology to tachyplesins and polyphemusins from horseshoe crabs; and (ii) buthinin, a 34-residue antibacterial (Gram-positive and Gram-negative) peptide with three disulfide bridges. The third peptide contains 37 residues and three disulfide bridges and clearly belongs to the family of anti-Gram-positive insect defensins. We have synthesized androctonin and explored its activity spectrum and mode of action.<p>

Apart from energy homeostasis leptin has been shown to be involved in a number of neuronal networks. The aim of this study was to investigate how the residual variance of leptin levels, after controlling for BMI, is linked to eating-disorder-specific psychopathology and sexual desire in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) compared to healthy controls. The sample included 57 subjects with acute AN and 77 healthy controls. Psychopathology was determined by EDI-2 and SCL-90-R and sexual problems were rated according to the Structured Interview of Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimic Syndromes (SIAB-EX). Plasma leptin was assessed by ELISA. Patients with a high drive for thinness had lower leptin levels at a given BMI and low leptin levels were associated with sexual problems, i.e. the absence of sexual desire and intimate relationships. Our results are in accordance with recent animal experiments linking low leptin levels with decreased sexual interest irrespective of body weight.<p>

Central venous catheters (CVC) are commonly used in clinical practice and are associated with several complications, including early and late onset infection. In these guidelines, an outline of good practice for the use of CVC and the prevention of associated infections is presented. Definitions of both localized and systemic catheter-related sepsis are given. Subsequent good practice in relation to the insertion of CVC, including patient preparation, planned duration of catheterization, catheter materials and design of the CVC, are presented. Skin fixation and insertion site care, including the use of dressings and administration sets, as well as an approach to flow obstructions, are also reviewed. The clinical and microbiological diagnosis of catheter-related sepsis and its treatment is next presented. Finally, guidelines for CVC removal and replacement are given. The guidelines are designed to facilitate the development of good practice in the use of CVC, allowing appropriate protocols to be formulated and to reduce infection risk.<p>

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Impairment of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier contributes to progression of HIV infection. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the HIV-induced intestinal barrier defect and to identify underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Epithelial barrier function was characterised by impedance spectroscopy and [(3)H]mannitol fluxes in duodenal biopsies from 11 untreated and 8 suppressively treated HIV-infected patients, and 9 HIV-seronegative controls. The villus/crypt ratio was determined microscopically. Epithelial apoptoses were analysed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labelling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 staining. Tight junction protein expression was quantified by densitometric analysis of immunoblots. Mucosal cytokine production was determined by cytometric bead array. RESULTS: Only in untreated but not in treated HIV-infected patients, epithelial resistance was reduced (13 (1) vs 23 (2) ohm cm(2), p&lt;0.01) and mannitol permeability was increased compared with HIV-negative controls (19 (3) vs 9 (1) nm/s, p&lt;0.05). As structural correlates, epithelial apoptoses and expression of the pore-forming claudin-2 were increased while expression of the sealing claudin-1 was reduced in untreated compared with treated patients and HIV-negative controls. Furthermore, villous atrophy was evident and mucosal production of interleukin 2 (IL2), IL4 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) was increased in untreated but not in treated HIV-infected patients. Incubation with IL2, IL4, TNFalpha and IL13 reduced the transepithelial resistance of rat jejunal mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Suppressive HAART abrogates HIV-induced intestinal barrier defect and villous atrophy. The HIV-induced barrier defect is due to altered tight junction protein composition and elevated epithelial apoptoses. Mucosal cytokines are mediators of the HIV-induced mucosal barrier defect and villous atrophy.<p>

We developed a decision rule to define a group of newborns eligible for discontinuation of antibiotic treatment 24 hours after initiation. The decision rule is based on two clinical assessments, three demographic variables, four maternal risk factors and six laboratory studies. The rule was created by retrospective analysis of all admissions to rule out sepsis at 10 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Region nurseries during a 2-month period in 1990. Of the 214 study subjects, 11 (5%) had a positive bacterial or viral culture result. No deaths occurred, but three babies who had negative culture results experienced late deterioration (after 24 hours in the special care nursery). After 24 hours of antibiotic treatment, 133 (67%) of the 199 babies who had negative culture results were asymptomatic, 36 (18%) had clear signs of illness and 30 (15%) had questionable signs of illness. The rule correctly identified all babies with positive culture results as well as all persistently symptomatic babies with negative culture results. The rule also identified 57 low-risk babies eligible for only 24 hours of antibiotic treatment. We tested the rule on a second data set. The rule identified 19 of 20 newborns with positive culture results in this independent group. The 20th baby was not identified because a required test (complete blood count at 12 to 24 hours of age) was not done. Under controlled clinical conditions, this baby could have returned to the nursery to complete antibiotic treatment. We concluded that early discontinuation of antibiotic treatment in selected newborns is safe and could lead to a 1 to 2% decrease in special care nursery days in our 10 hospitals.<p>

This study reports the activation of a latent mushroom tyrosinase isoform by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The activation process of latent mushroom tyrosinase by SDS is characterized by the presence of a lag period (tau) prior to the attainment of a steady-state rate (V(ss)). This could be related to a slow conformational change of the latent enzyme to render the active isoform. The molecular size of the latent isoform was 67 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and western-blotting assays. This size did not change after activation by SDS. The molecular size of the protease-activated isoform was 43 kDa. tau and V(ss) displayed a sigmoidal relationship to the concentration of SDS, but tau was not dependent on o-diphenol or enzyme concentration. Increasing SDS concentrations decreased tau, but then lower V(ss) values were detected because of a possible excess of unfolding and subsequent denaturation of the protein. The same reaction mechanism operated in both SDS-activated and protease-activated tyrosinase isoforms despite their different kinetic features. A possible mechanism for the activation of this latent tyrosinase by SDS is proposed.<p>

Infection of neonatal mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strain Armstrong (ARM) results in a lifelong persistent infection. Viral variants (cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL] negative, persistence positive [CTL- P+]) can be isolated from the lymphoid tissues of such mice. Adult mice inoculated with these CTL- P+ viruses fail to generate sufficient cytotoxic T lymphocytes to clear the acute infection and become persistently infected. By contrast, inoculation of a similar dose of the parental ARM virus (CTL+ P-) into adult mice leads to the generation of a vigorous virus-specific CTL response that clears the infection. Sequence analysis revealed a phenylalanine (Phe)-to-Leucine (Leu) change at amino acid 260 of the viral glycoprotein (GP) as a marker for variant viruses with the CTL- P+ phenotype. An RNA PCR assay that detects the variant GP sequence and thus allows kinetic studies of the selection of the Leu at position 260 was developed. We found that although CTL- P+ viruses are known to be lymphotropic, mature T and B cells were not required for the generation and selection of the Leu at GP amino acid 260. Kinetically, in mice infected at birth with LCMV ARM, as early as 3 weeks postinfection the Phe-to-Leu change was found in virus in the serum. By 5 weeks, viral nucleic acid obtained from peritoneal macrophages, spleen, lymph nodes, and liver showed the Phe-to-Leu change. At 2 months postinfection, the Leu change was detected in virus from the thymus, heart, lung, and kidney. By contrast, virus replicating in the central nervous system showed only minimal levels of the Leu change by 4 months and as long as 1 year postinfection. In vitro studies showed that the parental LCMV ARM CTL+ P- virus replicates more efficiently and outcompetes CTL- P+ virus in a cultured neuronal cell line, indicating that differential growth properties in neurons are likely the basis for the selection of the parental virus over the CTL- P+ variant in the brain.<p>

Neisseria meningitidis is an exclusively human pathogen that has evolved primarily to colonize the nasopharynx rather than to cause systemic disease. Colonization is the most frequent outcome following meningococcal infection and a prerequisite for invasive disease. The mechanism of colonization involves attachment of the organism to epithelial cells via bacterial type IV pili (Tfp), but subsequent events during colonization remain largely unknown. We analyzed 576 N. meningitidis mutants for their capacity to colonize human nasopharyngeal tissue in an organ culture model to identify bacterial genes required for colonization. Eight colonization-defective mutants were isolated. Two mutants were unable to express Tfp and were defective for adhesion to epithelial cells, which is likely to be the basis of their attenuation in nasopharyngeal tissue. Three other mutants are predicted to have lost previously uncharacterized surface molecules, while the remaining mutants have transposon insertions in genes of unknown function. We have identified novel meningococcal colonization factors, and this should provide insights into the survival of this important pathogen in its natural habitat.<p>

Artemia trypsin-like proteinase has been reported previously to be highly inhibited in the embryo (B. Ezquieta and C.G. Vallejo (1985) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 82B, 731-736). We report now that Artemia lipovitellin, the major storage protein complex, inhibits the proteinase. We have carried out an in vitro study of the characteristics of the inhibition. Lipovitellin, a glycolipoprotein of high molecular mass (650 kDa), behaves initially as a substrate but after a limited proteolysis becomes an inhibitor of the proteinase. The enzyme although inhibited in the hydrolysis of the protein substrate retains activity toward low molecular weight substrates. The residual activity on the protein substrate is inhibited by small inhibitors of the proteinase. These features of lipovitellin inhibition are reminiscent of the trap mechanism of alpha 2-macroglobulin inhibition, previously proposed as suitable for regulating proteolytic processes involved in development. Inhibition by lipovitellin is greater at low temperatures and has been determined at 17 and 37 degrees C, in the lower and higher part of the viable temperature range of Artemia development. At high temperature the proteinase hydrolyzes the inhibitor quite efficiently and the inhibition is lower. The inhibition by lipovitellin appears specific for Artemia trypsin-like proteinase when compared with other control pairs protein/proteinase. The results may provide support for an additional role of storage proteins as developmental inhibitors of proteinases.<p>

In crude extracts of eggs of the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata, maximum degradation of vitellin is at pH 3-3.5, whereas no proteolysis is detected at neutral or weakly acidic pHs. Acidic proteolysis is maintained at high level throughout embryonic development, and rapidly decreases in the larva, during the high phase of yolk degradation. Proteinase, acid phosphatase, and N-acetylglucosaminidase are localized within the yolk spheres; these can be considered as lysosomal-like organelles containing both substrate (vitellin) and the degradative machinery. Proteolytic activity has been essentially attributed to a cathepsin L-like enzyme through substrate specificity and inhibitors. The molecular weight is 37,000 to 39,000 as shown using gelatin-containing SDS-PAGE activity gels. At neutral pH the enzyme binds to vitellin, as demonstrated by gel filtration and PAGE under nondenaturing conditions. Acid proteinase activity at pH 5-6 is undetectable both with proteins and synthetic substrates, but is strongly increased after preincubation at pH 3-4. Activation at low pH could be important in the regulation of yolk degradation.<p>

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the need for an emergency pharmacist (EPh) program, discuss the evidence showing that an EPh program is effective, and provide information and resources that can be used by hospitals considering the implementation of an EPh program. EPh programs have existed since the 1970s, but until recently, they have been rare. Their development in the emergency department (ED) is a result of the unique clinical environment that exists in the ED, which is considered high risk for adverse drug events from a systems perspective. The primary aims of the EPh program are to diminish the risks of adverse events and to reduce costs. The innovative EPh program works with the varied staff in the ED to improve medication safety and provide pharmacologic information to staff. This paper provides substantiation of the value of an EPh program and describes the details of the EPh role when optimized for patient safety.<p>

Defects in apoptosis contribute to poor outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), calling for novel strategies that counter apoptosis resistance. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that small molecule inhibitors of the antiapoptotic protein XIAP cooperate with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in childhood acute leukemia cells. XIAP inhibitors at subtoxic concentrations, but not a structurally related control compound, synergize with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis and to inhibit clonogenic survival of acute leukemia cells, whereas they do not affect viability of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting some tumor selectivity. Analysis of signaling pathways reveals that XIAP inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced activation of caspases, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release in a caspase-dependent manner, indicating that they promote a caspase-dependent feedback mitochondrial amplification loop. Of note, XIAP inhibitors even overcome Bcl-2-mediated resistance to TRAIL by enhancing Bcl-2 cleavage and Bak conformational change. Importantly, XIAP inhibitors kill leukemic blasts from children with ALL ex vivo and cooperate with TRAIL to induce apoptosis. In vivo, they significantly reduce leukemic burden in a mouse model of pediatric ALL engrafted in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Thus, XIAP inhibitors present a promising novel approach for apoptosis-based therapy of childhood ALL.<p>

PURPOSE: To determine the effectiveness of the Marquette Method (MM) of natural family planning (NFP) as a method of avoiding pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a 12-month retrospective evaluation of the MM system of NFP. Two hundred and four women (mean age, 28.6 years) and their male partners (mean age, 30.3 years) who sought to learn a method for avoiding pregnancy with the MM from four clinical sites were taught to track their fertility by self-observation of cervical mucus, by use of an electronic monitor that measures urinary levels of estrone-3-glucuronide and luteinizing hormone, and by use of basal body temperature. All unintended pregnancies were evaluated by professional nurses as to whether they were intended or not. Pregnancy rates over 12 months of use were determined by survival analysis. RESULTS: There were a total of 12 unintended pregnancies, only 1 with correct use. The 12-month &quot;correct use&quot; pregnancy rate was 0.6 (i.e., 99.4% effective) and the &quot;typical use&quot; (total pregnancy rate) was 10.6 (i.e., 89.4% effective) per 100 users. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: When used correctly, the MM system of NFP is an effective means of avoiding pregnancy. The efficacy of the MM system includes proper preparation of the professional nurse NFP teachers.<p>

Felton, G. W. and C. B. Summers (1995). &quot;Antioxidant systems in insects.&quot; <u>Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology</u> <b>29</b>(2): 187-197.<p>
Insects possess a suite of antioxidant enzymes and small molecular weight antioxidants that may form a concatenated response to an onslaught of dietary and endogenously produced oxidants. Antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione transferase, and glutathione reductase have been characterized in insects. Water-soluble and lipid-soluble antioxidants such as ascorbate, glutathione, tocopherols, and carotenoids have not been well studied in insects but may play very important antioxidant roles. Additionally, the peritrophic matrix and trehalose may possess important antioxidant functions in insects. The enzymatic recycling of ascorbate, first noted in green plants, may also exist in insects. A greater understanding of these antioxidant systems may provide greater understanding about the ecological relationships of insects with their hosts.<p>

OBJECTIVE: In the mid-1990s, evidence emerged that air bag deployments could result in deaths to vulnerable vehicle occupants who were very close to air bag modules when they deployed. In 1997, federal frontal crash test requirements were modified to allow crash testing with unbelted dummies to be performed using sled tests. As a result, vehicle manufacturers were able to redesign air bags to deploy with less force and energy, thereby reducing the toll of air bag-induced deaths. However, there was concern that depowered air bags may not provide the same level of protection to unbelted occupants in severe frontal crashes, particularly occupants of large stature and body mass. This paper provides a summary of recent studies addressing this issue. METHODS: To expedite the accrual of data regarding air bag performance, the collection of additional crash data was funded by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. A panel of experts was commissioned to oversee the process and evaluate the data. During the past 6 years, a series of studies has been undertaken by panel members and others to evaluate the performance of redesigned air bags and the data are summarized here. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: There is now convincing evidence that the combination of air bag redesign and public education have resulted in dramatic reductions in air bag-induced infant and child deaths. In addition, the frontal crash fatality risks among children sitting in front seats have been reduced by as much as half, with younger children showing the greatest benefits. Among adult drivers and right-front passengers, there is no evidence for the predicted overall loss of protection with sled-certified air bags and there are far fewer air bag-induced deaths among this population. However, despite exhaustive analyses of frontal-crash data, the possibility of a somewhat elevated fatality risk among a subset of unbelted drivers in sled-certified 1998-1999 model vehicles cannot be ruled out. There also is some evidence that the risks of serious chest injury may be higher among unbelted drivers in frontal crashes in sled-certified vehicles with redesigned air bags. Further research is warranted to determine whether these differences remain in newer model vehicles designed to the advanced air bag rule, which took effect in 2003.<p>

PURPOSE: To determine the discrepancy rates of radiology residents interpreting emergent neuroradiology magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies and to assess any adverse clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred sixty-one brain and spine MR imaging and MR angiographic examinations that were ordered emergently after hours and given preliminary interpretations by radiology residents were retrospectively reviewed from December 1, 2006 to May 31, 2007 with institutional review board approval. Discrepancies between the interpretations of radiology residents and the final reports of attending neuroradiologists were classified as either false-negative (FN, failure to recognize abnormalities) or false-positive (FP, misinterpreting normal images as abnormal). Discrepancies that could affect patient care or clinical outcome were considered major. RESULTS: Overall, the agreement rate was 92.8%, the overall discrepancy rate was 7.2%, the major disagreement rate was 4.2%, and the minor disagreement rate was 2.2%. Misinterpretations among 1st-year residents on call were significant (P &lt; .04) when compared with more senior-level residents. There were 23 FN interpretations. The most common misses were acute stroke (n = 3), aneurysm (n = 3), vascular occlusion (n = 3), and disk herniation (n = 2). There were only three FP interpretations (misdiagnoses of syrinx, arachnoiditis, and acute infarct). CONCLUSION: There was no adverse clinical outcome as a result of misinterpretations, owing in part to rapid turnaround time for final reporting. Level of residency training has a significant effect on the rate of discrepancy, which may be mitigated by recent changes regarding 1st-year radiology residents' overnight call.<p>

A set of new instruments was designed to establish an access to the abdominal cavity for NOTES via the rectosigmoid. It comprehends a metal overtube which is positioned using a modified TEM device. The entry point is targeted by transrectal ultrasound and secured by a purse-string suture. Closure is achieved by means of a linear stapler application. The applicability of the system could already be confirmed in animal survival studies.<p>

INTRODUCTION: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are 2 gastrointestinal (GI) disorders that are chronic, are debilitating, and diminish quality of life and have no known etiology. Persons with IBD and/or IBS share similar signs and symptoms, although IBS does not result in intestinal inflammation/alteration or increase one's risk for colorectal cancer as does IBD. The literature reports different mechanisms by which to cope with a GI disorder; however, few studies have focused on the life experiences/coping abilities from the perspective of those who have a GI disorder. As such, exploring the lived experiences of women diagnosed with IBD and/or IBS would provide information about coping strategies from the perspective of those affected, which in turn would be useful for other individuals affected by these conditions and individuals treating patients with GI disorders. PURPOSE: The overall objective of this research was to explore the lived experiences of women diagnosed with the GI disorders of IBD and/or IBS. This article will focus on the strategies that women used for coping with such a diagnosis. METHODOLOGY: Eight women diagnosed with IBD and/or IBS were recruited from a university in southern Ontario, Canada. Each woman completed a background questionnaire, an e-mail interview, and a face-to-face interview. These data were subsequently analyzed for trends using phenomenology to direct the analysis. RESULTS: Women reported using a number of strategies to help them cope with their diagnosis of IBD or IBS: positive attitude, support, controlling the situation and surroundings, distraction/ignoring the problem, relaxation techniques, and education/knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: This research enables women to share their experiences concerning their coping strategies used in the management of IBD and/or IBS. The qualitative nature of this study provides the &quot;voice&quot; of women who have a GI disorder, which is often lacking in the literature, thus providing healthcare professionals with insight into the feelings and experiences of these women. The inability to understand the experiences of individuals with chronic conditions can act as a barrier in the treatment and interaction/rapport between healthcare professional and client.<p>

Two concentration-controlled trials (CCTs) defined the relationship between plasma concentrations of 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine (alovudine) and changes in surrogate markers of antiretroviral activity. In an initial open-label CCT involving 14 subjects infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), unacceptable hematologic toxicity occurred when the area under the concentration-time curve during a 12-h dosing interval (AUC12) was &gt; or = 300 ng*h/mL. Consequently, 46 subjects were assigned to AUC12s of 50, 100, or 200 ng*h/mL for up to 16 weeks in a prospective, randomized, double-blind CCT. Alovudine caused a concentration-dependent reduction in p24 antigen and peripheral blood mononuclear cell HIV titers within 4 weeks of start of treatment. The AUC12 producing a 50% reduction in p24 (108 ng*h/mL) had a trough concentration identical to the reported IC50 of alovudine in HIV-infected H9 cells. It may be possible to predict the antiretroviral activity of certain nucleoside analogues as a function of plasma drug concentration.<p>

The presence of an effective immune response in the hemocoel of arthropods is essential for survival as it prevents the invasion of pathogens throughout the animal body. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in this response by rapidly killing invading microorganisms. In this study, a novel cysteine-rich AMP has been isolated and characterized from the hemocytes of the cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. In addition to growth inhibition of Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, the newly described AMP, designated ixodidin (derived from the Family Ixodidae), was found to exert proteolytic inhibitory activity against two exogenous serine proteinases, elastase and chymotrypsin. This is the first report of a molecule of an arachnid that has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth and proteinase activity.<p>

Antifungal and antibacterial activities were detected in the hemolymph and gut contents of the cattle tick, Boophilus microplus. A peptide with antibacterial activity from the tick gut contents was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase chromatography. The molecular mass of the purified peptide was 3,205.7 Da, measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The amino acid sequence was obtained by Edman degradation and showed that the peptide was identical to a fragment of the bovine alpha-hemoglobin. A synthetic peptide based on the sequence obtained showed characterization data identical to those of the isolated material, confirming its structure. The synthetic peptide was active in micromolar concentrations against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. These data led us to conclude that the antibacterial activity detected in tick gut contents is the result of enzymatic processing of a host protein, hemoglobin. This activity may be used by ticks as a defense against microorganisms.<p>

BACKGROUND: Levodopa induced dyskinesias (LID) are a common problem which ultimately limit the effective treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). There is accumulating evidence that LID develop due to abnormal synaptic plasticity, which is in turn influenced by the release of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). METHODS: The influence of a common functional polymorphism of the BDNF gene on the risk of developing dyskinesias in a large cohort of patients with PD (n = 315), who were independently and variably treated with levodopa and/or other dopaminergic treatments, was investigated. RESULTS: Patients with the met allele of BDNF, associated with lower activity dependent secretion of BDNF, were at significantly higher risk of developing dyskinesias earlier in the course of treatment with dopaminergic agents (hazard ratio for each additional met allele 2.12, p = 0.001), which persisted following adjustment for potential confounding variables. CONCLUSION: This functional polymorphism may help predict which individuals are most at risk of LID and is consistent with the known actions of BDNF on synaptic plasticity in the striatum.<p>

BACKGROUND: A two-stage probability sample of patients recently discharged from 16 general acute care hospitals in Massachusetts were interviewed to determine the rates at which patients experience what they considered to be adverse events, to describe the kinds of events they reported, and to identify the correlates of those reports. METHODS: Eligible respondents were adults, 18 years of age or older, who were medical or surgical patients overnight or longer between April 1 and October 1, 2003, and who were discharged to their homes in Massachusetts. Questions covered perceptions of adverse events during hospitalizations and possible correlates of those events. Telephone interviews were carried out an average of nine months after discharge with 2,582 patients (response rate, 53%-60%). RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of respondents reported at least one unexpected &quot;negative&quot; event during their hospitalization. After physician review, the revised estimate was that 25% perceived that they had experienced at least one event that met our definition for an adverse event. The most common reported events were reactions to newly prescribed drugs (40%) and the effects of surgery (34%). Physician reviewers coded 57% of the adverse events as &quot;significant&quot; and 18% as &quot;serious&quot; or &quot;life-threatening.&quot; The physician reviewers also rated 31% of the reported adverse events as likely to be preventable. DISCUSSION: The estimate that one in four hospital patients experienced an adverse event is considerably higher than the published rates based on hospital record review, indicating the potential value of surveys for studies of patient safety. Because of nonresponse among older patients, that estimate is probably an underestimate. Designs that would reduce lags between discharge and interviews and decrease hospital nonresponses would reduce two key threats to confidence in the survey results.<p>

PURPOSE: Myelography in combination with a postmyelography CT is an important presurgical examination because of its excellent visualisation of the disc, the bone and the contrast-filled dura. Side effects after myelography can be observed in up to 50% of patients. The pathophysiological mechanism is thought to be increased cerebrospinal fluid leakage at the puncture site. Since the introduction by Sprotte in 1979 of the pencil-point needle, a modification of Whitacre's needle, fewer complaints after lumbar puncture have been reported. The aim of the study was to examine the influence of two types of needle points and the temperature (37 degrees C vs 21 degrees C) of the contrast medium (CM; iotrolan, Isovist) on the incidence of side effects of lumbar puncture for myelography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized trial the incidence of complaints after lumbar puncture with intrathecal CM application was evaluated by the use of a 21-G pencil-point needle as modified by Sprotte compared to our usual 22-G needle with a Quincke bevel. Some 412 patients (201 female, 211 male; mean age 54.05 +/- 7.4 years) were investigated. Directly after examination and 1. 3 and 5 days later the patients were questioned about complaints (headache, neck stiffness nausea, vomiting, buzzing in the ear and dizziness). The results were tested by the chi square test. RESULTS: A significantly lower incidence of complaints was seen after lumbar puncture with the pencil-point needle/Quincke needle (headache: 6.3%/18.9%, P &lt; 0.0001; headache lasting 3 days: 0.5%/7.8%, P &lt; 0.0001; headache lasting 5 days: 0%/2.4%, P = 0.0305; nausea: 0%/4.9%, P = 0.0009; vomiting: 0%/3.4%, P = 0.0009; dizziness: 0%/3.4%, P = 0.0074; neck stiffness: 0%/3.4%, P = 0.0074). The temperature of the CM had no influence on the complaints. No influence was seen on the quality of the myelogram. No relation to sex and age was found. CONCLUSION: Complaints after lumbar puncture and myelography are caused by the cerebrospinal fluid leakage at the puncture site. The incidence of side effects related to this leakage can be reduced by using a pencil-point needle. The temperature of the CM has no influence on the complaints.<p>

The first dimeric catalase-peroxidase of eucaryotic origin, an intracellular hydroperoxidase from Penicillium simplicissimum which exhibited both catalase and peroxidase activities, has been isolated. The enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of about 170 kDa and is composed of two identical subunits. The purified protein has a pH optimum for catalase activity at 6.4 and for peroxidase at 5.4. Both activities are inhibited by cyanide and azide whereas 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole has no effect. 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol and 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) all serve as substrates. The optical spectrum of the purified enzyme shows a Soret band at 407 nm. Reduction by dithionite results in the disappearance of the Soret band and formation of three absorption maxima at 440, 562 and 595 nm. The prosthetic group was identified as a protoheme IX and EPR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a histidine residue as proximal ligand. In addition to the catalase-peroxidase, an atypical catalase which is active over a broad pH range was also partially purified from P. simplicissimum. This catalase is located in the periplasm and contains a chlorin-type heme as prosthetic group.<p>

Solifuges lack oxygen-carrying proteins like hemocyanins found in other chelicerates. For conduction of gases, therefore, we hypothesize that the tracheal system is divided into convective and respiratory parts, the latter having intimate association with respiring cells, tissues and organs. This hypothesis is supported by studies of tracheae in other arthropods. We used light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy to examine the tracheae of Galeodes granti (Chelicerata, Solifugae). We studied tracheae in cheliceral and leg muscles, midgut and midgut diverticula, the heart and the supra- and subesophageal ganglia of the central nervous system. In all tissues examined, the tracheae penetrate into tissues and can be found between cells. Terminal branches with diameter less than one micron were found embedded into cell bodies of respiring tissue, thus reducing the diffusion distance. We suggest that the terminal branches are specialized for respiratory function due to their thin intima, with reduced endocuticle and exocuticle. Comparison with other tracheate chelicerates suggests parallel evolution of a common tracheal pattern based on homologous cellular building materials within the chelicerates and arthropods.<p>

Minimally Invasive (MI) surgery represents the future of many types of medical intervention (keyhole neurosurgery, natural orifice trans-luminal endoscopic surgery, etc.). However, the shortcomings of today's surgical tools fuel the need for the development of next-generation 'smart instrumentation', which will be more accurate and safer for the patient. This paper presents the preliminary results of a biologically inspired microtexturing method, based on UV-lithography, and its application to MI neurosurgery. These results suggest that the size and geometry of the texture 'printed' on the outer surface of a neurosurgical probe clearly affect the insertion and extraction forces generated at the brain-probe interface. Thus, by carefully choosing an appropriate microtexture, unique insertion characteristics can be obtained, which can improve the performance of existing instruments (e.g. reducing slippage in permanent electrodes such as those used in deep brain stimulation) or enable the development of novel designs altogether.<p>

Freeman, M. R., et al. (1994). &quot;Frequency of transient reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction at rest in coronary artery disease.&quot; <u>American Journal of Cardiology</u> <b>74</b>(2): 137-143.<p>
To determine the prevalence of decreases in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) at rest in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), including those with stable angina (n = 21), unstable angina (n = 13), and recent myocardial infarction (n = 11), continuous assessment of LV function for 162 +/- 136 minutes was performed using a new nuclear device. The results were compared with those of a group of normal subjects (n = 10) monitored for 80 +/- 28 minutes. Episodes of EF reduction of &gt; 7% from baseline for a total duration of &gt; 5% monitored time occurred in 0 of 10 normal subjects; episodes were more frequent in patients with stable angina (10 of 21, 48%; p = 0.01), with recent myocardial infarction (7 of 11, 64%; p = 0.004), and with unstable angina (11 of 13, 85%; p = 0.0001). The number of EF decreases per hour in patients after myocardial infarction (1.7 +/- 2.5 [SD]) and unstable angina (1.2 +/- 0.7) was significantly more frequent than in normal subjects (0.3 +/- 0.4), but was not different from that in patients with stable angina (0.8 +/- 1.0). The duration of the decrease in EF, expressed as minutes per hour of monitored time in normal subjects (0.7 +/- 1.0%), was significantly less than in patients with unstable angina (10 +/- 8%). Patients with stable angina (6 +/- 9%) and recent myocardial infarction (6 +/- 6%) were not significantly different from normal subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

BACKGROUND: The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH), a popular model for primary care reorganization, includes several structural capabilities intended to enhance quality of care. The extent to which different types of primary care practices have adopted these capabilities has not been previously studied. OBJECTIVE: To measure the prevalence of recommended structural capabilities among primary care practices and to determine whether prevalence varies among practices of different size (number of physicians) and administrative affiliation with networks of practices. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. PARTICIPANTS: One physician chosen at random from each of 412 primary care practices in Massachusetts was surveyed about practice capabilities during 2007. Practice size and network affiliation were obtained from an existing database. MEASUREMENTS: Presence of 13 structural capabilities representing 4 domains relevant to quality: patient assistance and reminders, culture of quality, enhanced access, and electronic health records (EHRs). MAIN RESULTS: Three hundred eight (75%) physicians responded, representing practices with a median size of 4 physicians (range 2-74). Among these practices, 64% were affiliated with 1 of 9 networks. The prevalence of surveyed capabilities ranged from 24% to 88%. Larger practice size was associated with higher prevalence for 9 of the 13 capabilities spanning all 4 domains (P &lt; 0.05). Network affiliation was associated with higher prevalence of 5 capabilities (P &lt; 0.05) in 3 domains. Associations were not substantively altered by statistical adjustment for other practice characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Larger and network-affiliated primary care practices are more likely than smaller, non-affiliated practices to have adopted several recommended capabilities. In order to achieve PCMH designation, smaller non-affiliated practices may require the greatest investments.<p>

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this proof-of-principle study was to evaluate contrast-enhanced sonography in the characterization of adrenal masses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutively registered patients with newly detected adrenal masses underwent hormonal evaluation and duplex and Doppler sonography followed by contrast-enhanced sonography and CT or MRI. The dynamics of contrast enhancement were analyzed with time-intensity curves. CT and MRI were used as the reference methods for the diagnosis of adenoma and myelolipoma. Metastasis was diagnosed with fine-needle biopsy, and all other adrenal masses were diagnosed at adrenalectomy. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate the criteria for diagnosis of malignant adrenal masses. RESULTS: Size greater than 4 cm and hypervascularization were found significantly more often in malignant than in benign lesions (71% vs 21% for size; 57% vs 7% for hypervascularization). At contrast-enhanced sonography, early arterial or arterial contrast enhancement and rapid washout were seen in all patients with primary or secondary malignant lesions of the adrenal gland and in only 22% of patients with benign adrenal masses (p &lt; 0.05). All primary malignant lesions were confirmed at histologic examination. In 32 of 35 patients (91%), findings at CT or MRI were congruent with those at contrast-enhanced sonography in regard to characterization of adenoma versus nonadenomatous lesion (p &lt; 0.001). In two of the 35 cases, however, all imaging methods favored the diagnosis of nonadenomatous lesion, but the histologic result after adrenalectomy was adrenal adenoma. The sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced sonography in the diagnosis of malignant adrenal mass were 100% and 82%. CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced sonography can be used to differentiate adenomas and nonadenomatous lesions with a sensitivity comparable with that of CT and MRI and may be a cost-effective method for preselection of patients with adrenal masses.<p>

Fries, P., et al. (2008). &quot;Magnetic resonance imaging of the spine at 3 Tesla.&quot; <u>Semin Musculoskelet Radiol</u> <b>12</b>(3): 238-252.<p>
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has developed dramatically in the 25 years since its clinical introduction. Advances in hardware design have included the development of high field magnets and more sophisticated and sensitive coils. Improvements in sequences, data sampling, and postprocessing software have benefited the attainable spatial and temporal resolution to the point at which the fine depiction of anatomical structure and pathological processes is now routine. As in other radiological areas, the most recent advances in MRI have proven highly valuable in the field of musculoskeletal radiology where the lack of radiation, high soft tissue contrast, and capacity for multiplanar or three-dimensional imaging have made MRI the imaging modality of choice. Particular benefits are seen in diagnostic imaging of the spine where MRI is clearly superior to both conventional radiography and computed tomography. In this article, we discuss the impact of the most recent technological advance in MRI, namely the advent of 3 Tesla (3-T) imaging, on diagnostic imaging of the spine. Comparisons are drawn with imaging at 1.5 T, and emphasis is placed on MR physics and on the benefits and principal difficulties associated with spine imaging at high field strength.<p>

Fritz, S., et al. (2008). &quot;Prophylactic antibiotic treatment is superior to therapy on-demand in experimental necrotising pancreatitis.&quot; <u>Critical Care (London, England)</u> <b>12</b>(6): R141.<p>
INTRODUCTION: High morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe acute pancreatitis are mainly caused by bacterial superinfection of pancreatic necrosis and subsequent sepsis. The benefit of early prophylactic antibiotics remains controversial because clinical studies performed to date were statistically underpowered. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate on-demand versus prophylactic antibiotic treatment in a standardised experimental model. METHODS: Treatment groups received meropenem either therapeutically 24 hours after induction of necrotising pancreatitis or prophylactically before development of pancreatic superinfection. At 24 and 72 hours, pancreatic injury was investigated by histology and translocation by bacterial cultures of pancreatic tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes. Septic complications were evaluated by blood cultures and survival. RESULTS: Without antibiotic treatment, pancreatic superinfection was observed in almost all cases after induction of necrotising pancreatitis. The 72-hour-mortality rate was 42.9% and bacterial infection of mesenteric lymph nodes and bacteraemia was found in 87.5% of the surviving animals. Therapeutic administration of meropenem on-demand reduced bacteraemia to 50% and mortality to 27.3%. However, prophylactic antibiotic treatment significantly reduced bacteraemia to 25.0% (p = 0.04) and pancreatic superinfection as well as mortality to 0% (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively) compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study both prophylactic and delayed antibiotic treatment on-demand reduced septic complications in a standardised setting of experimental necrotising pancreatitis. However, pancreatic superinfection, bacteraemia and mortality rates were reduced significantly by early treatment. Thus, in the absence of statistically relevant and well-designed clinical trials, the study demonstrates that prophylactic antibiotic treatment is superior to antibiotic treatment on-demand.<p>

Biogenesis of thylakoid membranes in both chloroplasts and cyanobacteria is largely not understood today. The vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (Vipp1) has been suggested to be essential for thylakoid membrane formation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), as well as in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, although its exact physiological function remains elusive so far. Here, we report that, upon depletion of Vipp1 in Synechocystis cells, the number of thylakoid layers in individual Synechocystis cells decreased, and that, in particular, the content of photosystem I (PSI) complexes was highly diminished in thylakoids. Furthermore, separation of native photosynthetic complexes indicated that PSI trimers are destabilized and the monomeric species is enriched. Therefore, depletion of thylakoid membranes specifically affects biogenesis and/or stabilization of PSI in cyanobacteria.<p>

OBJECTIVES: The role of fundoplication in patients with pure type II paraesophageal hiatal hernia remains controversial. Conventional thinking suggests that because the lower esophageal sphincter is located within the abdomen, it is competent, and fundoplication is unnecessary. Few studies have used objective evaluation to guide the addition of an antireflux procedure. METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients with type II paraesophageal hernia were treated between May 1991 and July 1994. All had radiographic criteria of pure type II hernias. Preoperative evaluation included upper intestinal endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour ambulatory pH monitoring. The lower esophageal sphincter was considered incompetent if any of the following criteria were present: a resting pressure less than 7 mm Hg, an overall sphincter length less than 2 cm, or an intraabdominal length less than 1 cm. Primary symptoms responsible for surgery were related to the hernia in 73% of patients: dysphagia or postprandial abdominal pain in six patients, abdominal distension or vomiting in four patients, and bleeding in one patient. Symptoms typical of gastroesophageal reflux were present in four patients: heartburn and regurgitation in two each. RESULTS: Objective evidence of gastroesophageal reflux was present in the majority of patients. Five patients (31%) had evidence of esophageal injury: esophagitis in three patients, stricture in one, and esophageal ulcer in one. In 11 of 15 patients (69%), pathologic esophageal acid exposure was detected by 24-hour pH monitoring. Twelve patients (75%) had a defective lower esophageal sphincter, usually the result of an inadequate intraabdominal length (8/12, 66%). Hernia reduction, crural closure, and Nissen fundoplication were performed in 14 patients (one patient awaits surgery). Symptomatic relief was excellent in all cases. No patient has had hernia recurrence at an average of 14 months' follow-up (range 2 to 39 months). CONCLUSION: Objective evaluation reveals that gastroesophageal reflux accompanies type II paraesophageal hernia in a high proportion of patients, usually because of an incompetent lower esophageal sphincter. Appropriate treatment includes reduction of the hernia, crural closure, and fundoplication in most, if not all, patients.<p>

In oviparous species, proteins and lipids are found in the vitellus forming lipoproteins called lipovitellins. They are an important energy source for embryos development and larvae growth and survival. We have previously isolated and partially characterized the sole egg cytosolic lipovitellin from the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium borellii. It is a native protein of 440 kDa, composed of two subunits of 94 and 112 kDa. In the present work we studied size, shape and structure of M. borellii lipovitellin using electron microscopy, crosslinking reagents, MALDI-TOF, circular dichroism, fluorescence and partial proteolysis. The results showed that lipovitellin has a quasi spherical morphology with an estimated diameter of 18.5+/-3.5 nm. It appears to be composed of two subunits of 94 kDa, and one of 112 kDa. The larger subunit is more susceptible to trypsinolysis, indicating that it is less compactly folded and/or more exposed to the aqueous medium than the 94 kDa subunits. The hetero-trimer is held together by non-covalent interactions. Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF, produced 42 polypeptides matching to a vitellogenin of a related species (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). Circular dichroism indicated that this protein contains 35.7% alpha-helix, 16.6% beta-sheet and 20% turns. Tryptophan fluorescence emission, at a maximum of 334 nm, indicated that the environment polarity of these aromatic residues is similar to that of other crustacean lipoproteins.<p>

Lipovitellin (LV) is essential in crustacean eggs for embryo viability and development. Two LV were isolated from eggs of Macrobrachium borellii. corresponding to early (LVe ) and late (LVl) embryo developing stages. They differ in lipid composition but not in lipid/protein ratio or apoprotein composition. Structural information was obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy, far-UV circular dichroism, partial trypsinolysis and electron microscopy applied to LVe and LVl and two partially delipidated forms of LVe generated by phospholipase A2 (LVp) or Triton X-100 (LVt) treatment. All LV forms contained two apoprotein subunits of 94 and 112 kDa, being the 112k Da subunit more accessible to trypsinolysis in all. Only in LVp, different cleavage sites appeared. Secondary structure was similar in LVe and LVl, but LVp and LVt showed a small increase in beta-sheet at expense of alpha-helix. Electron microscopy revealed a spheroidal morphology in all LV and a decreased size in LVp. Delipidated LVs were more resistant to denaturation with guanidinium-HCl. Acrylamide quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was more efficient in delipidated LVs, probably due to apolipoprotein rearrangement, as reinforced by fluorescence anisotropy. It is concluded that LV stability, shape, and apoprotein conformation is not largely affected by the changes in lipid composition that take place during embryogenesis.<p>

The prawn Macrobrachium borellii has lecithotrophic eggs with highly-abbreviated development. The major yolk component is lipovitellin (LV), a lipoprotein with 30% lipids (by weight). LV consumption during embryogenesis was followed by ELISA and Western blot analysis using an anti-LV polyclonal antibody. No cross-reacting proteins were observed and LV-like lipoproteins were strongly recognized by the antibody in hemolymph (vitellogenin), yolk (LV) and embryos (LVe), as determined by Western Blot analysis. LV decreased significantly along development from 9.4 to 1.1 microg/mg egg. Consumption rate of LV was slow in early embryogenesis, followed by a rapid utilization in late embryonic stages. Significant LVe amounts were still present at hatching. LV apolipoproteins were selectively degraded during embryo development, being the highest molecular weight subunit the most affected. Comparison among in vitro, in vivo and theoretical proteolysis suggested that trypsin may be involved in LV degradation during late embryogenesis. Embryo lipoprotein (HDLe) synthesis was first detected at stage 6. HDLe shared the same density, MW and subunit composition as adult hemolymph HDL(1) and did not cross-react with LV-like lipoproteins. Though expressed at low concentration, it fulfilled embryo needs for lipid transport among organs.<p>

Crustacean lipids are transported in the hemolymph by an HDL. The hepatopancreas is the most important and active organ regarding lipid metabolism, so we studied the interchange of FA and acylglycerols between both components of the hepatopancreas-hemolymph system in the decapod crustacean Macrobrachium borellii. The hepatopancreas and a sole plasma lipoprotein were labeled by in vivo incubations with 14C palmitic acid injected into the hemolymph. Then they were incubated in vitro with unlabeled hepatopancreas and hemolymph, and the transfer of lipids between them was measured by radiochromatographic techniques. It was determined in vivo that more than 80% of the circulating palmitic acid was taken up by the hepatopancreas and incorporated into PC and TAG. Both classes of lipids, but mainly PC, were transferred back from tissues to the hemolymph. Lipid transfer was also demonstrated in vitro. The transfer of PC (30% of labeling) as well as that of FFA (48% of labeling) from hemolymph to hepatopancreas was determined. On the other hand, FFA were released more efficiently than the acylglycerols from intact hepatopancreas to hemolymph, and they were the only lipid transferred when the hepatopancreas had been previously washed.<p>

BACKGROUND: Assessment of the likelihood of platelet activation (i.e. platelet reactivity) identifies patients at high and low risk of subsequent thrombotic events. Turbidometric platelet aggregation has been used to assess platelet function for more than 4 decades. We have developed a method to assess individual components of platelet activation with the use of flow cytometry that is performed in minimally altered whole blood. AIMS: To compare assessment of platelet reactivity determined with the use of aggregometry and flow cytometry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty adult patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease were included in this study. Blood from each patient was used to determine turbidometric platelet aggregation and to assess platelet activation by flow cytometry. ADP was used as the agonist. Values are means +/- SEM. Comparison was performed with the use of Student's t test and correlation was assessed with the use of Pearson's correlation analysis. RESULTS: Both maximal aggregation and the slope of aggregation correlate with the percentage of platelets that bound fibrinogen in response to 0.2 microM ADP. The best correlation was seen between the slope of aggregation induced by 0.2 or 1 microM ADP and the percentage of platelets that bound fibrinogen in response to 0.2 microM ADP (for 0.2 microM r = 0.62, p = 0.038; for 1 microM r = 0.71, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: The binding of fibrinogen to activated platelets assessed with the use of flow cytometry correlates best with the slope of turbidometric aggregation and appears to reflect the propensity of platelets to activate.<p>

Part A: Molecular and Integrative Physiology</u> <b>135</b>(1): 147-154.<p>
The influence of temperature on biochemical composition, survival and duration of development of Cherax quadricarinatus from egg extrusion to juvenile was analyzed. Berried females were individually subjected to each of 22, 25, 28 and 31 degrees C (n=5 per temperature). Egg samples were obtained every 3 days from egg extrusion to juvenile stage for biochemical analysis. Duration of development and survival decreased with increasing temperature. At 22 and 25 degrees C half of the initial lipid content was consumed during development. At 28 and 31 degrees C, 80% of the initial amount of lipids was consumed. For proteins, depletion rate was significantly lower at 25 degrees C (36% of the initial amount) than at 22, 28 and 31 degrees C (61-65% of the initial amount). For carbohydrates, a significant consumption was observed only at 22 degrees C. Total energy consumption was lower at 22 and 25 degrees C than at 28 and 31 degrees C. We conclude that 22-25 degrees C is the optimal temperature range for C. quadricarinatus egg incubation, although 25 degrees C might be better in terms of development duration in terms of survival, energy cost and protein consumption.<p>

58 out of 69 patients after open operation for osteochondritis dissecans (OD) of the upper ankle joint were reexamined retrospectively. In 44 cases the medial talar edge was concerned, in 15 the lateral one. Pain in activity resisting conservative treatment led to the operations. 31 excisions, 16 drillings, 10 autogenous bone graftings (2 external) and 2 diagnostic arthrotomies had been carried out. Medial malleolar osteotomy had to be performed in 22 cases, mainly concerning excisions and graftings to maintain sufficient survey of the lesion. Follow-up examination took place an average 67 months postoperatively. The results were obtained through a new scoring system with special regard to subjective and clinical criteria. 13 excellent, 29 good, 10 fair and 7 bad results were obtained. Results depended mainly on operative approach, location of the lesion and in lateral OD time of operation. Medial malleolar osteotomy frequently led to local osteoarthritis and less favourable clinical findings. No significant difference could be realized for size of the lesion and the applied operative technique. Stage and age at time of operation did not clearly influence the outcome. The indication for operation must be made dependant on individual complaints. Even in the era of arthroscopy medial malleolar osteotomy sometimes is necessary, but goes along with higher morbidity and worse prognosis. Operations have to be carried out according to stage and followed by proper rehabilitation to render proper assessment. Lateral lesions result from sprains and should be operated early.<p>

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate hyaline cartilage defects treated with cell-seeded artificial matrix systems (two different collagen type I gels) with the method of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to correlate the results with conventional histological and immunocytochemical staining. METHOD: Osteochondral blocks were harvested from 20 patients undergoing total knee replacement and trimmed to 2 x 2 cm. Under sterile conditions, chondral defects of 8 mm diameter were either filled with a collagen type I gel plug seeded with autologous chondrocytes (2 x 10 (5)/mL gel), or with a corresponding gel plug which was stabilised by a 20-fold compression. Of each group, 5 specimens were cultivated for 6 weeks under standardised in vitro conditions (37 degrees C, 5 % CO (2), humidified atmosphere), while the remaining 5 specimens were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice (BALBc -/-). Immediately after recovery, the repair tissue and bonding zones were investigated by OCT. Subsequently, specimens were decalcified and investigated by H&amp;E staining and collagen type II immunostaining. The results of OCT and conventional staining were correlated. RESULTS: By OCT, repair tissue could be investigated up to 1.6 mm in depth, physically limited by the utilised OCT system. In the denser hyaline cartilage regions, OCT resolution was reduced. Regardless of cultivation (in vitro or nude mouse), ultrastructural features of the repair tissue could be demonstrated. In particular, ultrastructural differences between the two investigated collagen gels could be detected. Moreover, the bonding region between repair tissue and hyaline cartilage could be evaluated by OCT investigation. The results of the OCT measurements were confirmed by H&amp;E and collagen type II immunostaining. CONCLUSION: By OCT, repair tissue generated by the treatment of cartilage defects with tissue-engineered matrix systems could be evaluated in vitro. Future studies may show if repair tissue quality may be monitored in situ by OCT.<p>

The maintenance of a differentiated chondrocyte phenotype is influenced by several factors of which signal transduction of extracellular stimuli through the cell membrane is of major interest. One important group of membrane-bound proteins which are involved in transmembrane signal transduction are ion channels. Human articular chondrocytes were obtained from osteoarthritic femoral condyles. Cells were released from the surrounding matrix and cultivated under standard conditions. We investigated gene expression of 12 members of the TRP ion channel family of freshly prepared (passage 0; P0) and in vitro propagated human articular chondrocytes (passage 2; P2) using conventional and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). In addition, the protein appearance of four TRP channels was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Chondrocyte differentiation was monitored by quantification of collagen type-II, type-I, and aggrecan gene expression. By conventional PCR, 8 channels could be detected, of which some displayed a heterogeneous PCR pattern. RT-PCR quantification revealed that TRPC1 was expressed on the same level in P0 and P2 chondrocytes while gene expression of TRPC3 and TRPC6 was elevated in passage 2 cells. TRPM5, TRPM7, and TRPV1 displayed an enhanced gene expression in freshly isolated chondrocytes. Immunofluorescence signal intensity of all four investigated TRP proteins was consistent with the corresponding gene expression data. In the present study, a correlation between the appearance of some members of the TRP ion channel family and the state of de-differentiation of osteoarthritic articular chondrocytes was shown. A possible direct involvement in the process of chondrocyte de-differentiation has to be investigated in further studies.<p>

Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital bone-marrow-failure syndrome, is characterized by red blood cell aplasia, macrocytic anemia, clinical heterogeneity, and increased risk of malignancy. Although anemia is the most prominent feature of DBA, the disease is also characterized by growth retardation and congenital anomalies that are present in approximately 30%-50% of patients. The disease has been associated with mutations in four ribosomal protein (RP) genes, RPS19, RPS24, RPS17, and RPL35A, in about 30% of patients. However, the genetic basis of the remaining 70% of cases is still unknown. Here, we report the second known mutation in RPS17 and probable pathogenic mutations in three more RP genes, RPL5, RPL11, and RPS7. In addition, we identified rare variants of unknown significance in three other genes, RPL36, RPS15, and RPS27A. Remarkably, careful review of the clinical data showed that mutations in RPL5 are associated with multiple physical abnormalities, including craniofacial, thumb, and heart anomalies, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominantly present in patients carrying mutations in RPL11. We also demonstrate that mutations of RPL5, RPL11, or RPS7 in DBA cells is associated with diverse defects in the maturation of ribosomal RNAs in the large or the small ribosomal subunit production pathway, expanding the repertoire of ribosomal RNA processing defects associated with DBA.<p>

Five of the six families with the Berardinelli-Seip syndrome in Norway cluster in six adjacent rural municipalities of south-western Norway. The six patients from this area were born between 1951 and 1973, none between 1974 and 1995. The absence of new cases may be explained by a decrease in the intraregion marriage rate and inbreeding. Genealogical investigations show that the mutation must have occurred at least 400 years ago. The sixth family was clinically different and geographically sporadic from a Finnish-descent rural East Norwegian population. A genetic linkage study of all six families revealed fresh crossovers versus the disease allele in nine DNA marker systems and the absence of recombination in three (maximum lod score + 1.3). None of the last showed allelic association. These families are included in an international effort to map the CLBS locus. The patients have been included in the homozygosity testing of totally 28 patients in an international collaborative study. The three patients, assumed identical in descent from both parents, were jointly homozygous in none of the 250 dinucleotide markers tested. A heterochromatic 9qh + segregated from one parent in two families.<p>

Scorpions of the Family Buthidae have lower water loss rates (WLR) and enhanced osmoregulatory capacities in comparison with sympatric species of F. Scorpionidae. In this study we followed changes in water content of different body compartments in four scorpion species under prolonged desiccation conditions. The high initial WLR previously reported for Scorpionidae result in rapid depletion of body water stores. A significant decrease in total body water content of Scorpionidae was recorded following loss of only 5% of initial mass, whereas no such decrease was recorded for Buthidae following severe desiccation. When desiccated, scorpions lose water primarily from the hepatopancreas, while haemolymph volume is more tightly regulated. However, the haemolymph volume of Scorpionidae decreases as a result of depletion of hepatopancreas water stores following severe desiccation. The increasing lipid fraction in the hepatopancreas of Scorpionidae during desiccation suggests that depletion of body water stores may induce enhanced catabolism of carbohydrates, which may contribute to volume regulation by making initially glycogen-bound water available to the desiccating scorpion.<p>

Part A: Molecular and Integrative Physiology</u> <b>182</b>: 58-63.<p>
Scorpions exhibit some of the lowest recorded water loss rates among terrestrial arthropods. Evaporative water loss to the surrounding environment occurs mainly through the integument, and thus its resistance to water loss has paramount significance for the ability of scorpions to tolerate extremely dry habitats. Cuticular hydrocarbons (HCs) deposited on the outer epicuticle play an important role in determining cuticular waterproofing, and seasonal variation in both cuticular HC quantity and composition has been shown to correlate with water loss rates. Precursor incorporation rates into cuticle HCs have been observed to be extremely low in scorpions compared with insects. We therefore used adult male Buthus occitanus (Buthidae) in order to test HC profile plasticity during acute exposure to 14 d and 28 d of experimental desiccation. Cuticular HC profile of hydrated scorpions was similar to that reported for several other scorpion species, consisting of similar fractions of n-alkanes and branched alkanes, with no evidence for unsaturation. Most abundant of the n-alkanes were n-heptacosane (C27; 19+/-2% of total HCs), n-nonacosane (C29; 16+/-1%) and n-hentriacontane (C31; 11+/-1%). Exposure to desiccation stress resulted in a significant increase in the total amount of extracted HCs, and in the relative abundance of branched alkanes at the expense of n-alkanes. Together with an increase in HC chain lengths, these changes mimic previously-reported seasonal variation among freshly-collected specimens. This indicates that scorpions respond to water shortage by regulating the properties of their passive integumental barrier to water loss.<p>

Terrestrial arthropods lose body water to the environment mainly through transpiration. The aim of this study was to determine the fraction of respiratory losses from total transpiratory water loss in scorpions, as relatively high respiratory losses would indicate a fitness benefit from regulation of gas-exchange rate under stressful desiccating conditions. We measured metabolic rates and water-loss rates of Hadrurus arizonensis (Iuridae) at a range of ecologically-relevant temperatures. Calculation of respiratory water losses was based on increased metabolic and water-loss rates during nocturnal activity (assuming no change in cuticular resistance at a given constant experimental temperature). Respiratory losses accounted for 9.0+/-1.7% of total transpiratory losses at 25 degrees C, doubled to 17.9+/-1.8% at 30 degrees C and increased to 31.0+/-2.0% at 35 degrees C (n=5, 15 and 15, respectively). Furthermore, the relative importance of respiratory transpiration is likely to be higher at temperatures above 35 degrees C, which have been recorded even within the burrows of H. arizonensis. Measurements of cuticular lipid melting points do not provide evidence for increased cuticular resistance to water loss at higher temperatures. However, the relatively high fraction of respiratory water losses reported here for H. arizonensis supports the notion of respiratory regulation as an evolved mechanism for conserving scorpion body water stores under stressful conditions.<p>

The results of numerical calculations of water-droplet explosions initiated by intense CO(2)-laser radiation are presented. The theoretical model for this process is based on the solution of the value of the thermal-boundary problem in an inhomogeneously heated droplet, including the kinetic equation describingvapor generation in a superheated liquid. The main characteristics of droplet explosions (e.g., degree of explosive evaporation and time of explosion) are calculated. It is established that these characteristics depend on the heating rate of the droplet and on its radius. The results point to the fact that two droplet-heating regimes can be distinguished-slow heating and rapid heating-based on the behavior of the explosive boiling process. This division represents the competition of real physical processes in an irradiated droplet and makes it possible to separate the basic, specific features of the explosion process.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relative risk associated with lower uterine segment involvement (LUSI) on outcome measures in patients with apparent stage I endometroid endometrial cancer. METHODS: A cohort of 769 consecutive patients with endometroid endometrial carcinoma apparent stage I, who underwent surgery in five gynecological oncology centers in Israel; 138 patients with and 631 without LUSI were followed for a median time of 51 months. Local recurrence, recurrence-free and overall survival were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: LUSI was associated with grade 3 tumor (p=0.002), deep myometrial invasion (p&lt;0.001), and the presence of lymphvascular space involvement (p=0.01). There were 22 cases of local recurrences, 40 cases of distal recurrences and 80 patients died. Univariate survival analysis showed that patients with LUSI had trend toward lower regional recurrence-free survival (p=0.09), and significant lower distant recurrence-free survival (p=0.04) and lower overall survival (p=0.002). The Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated a significantly decreased overall survival (HR=2.3; 95% CI 1.3, 3.9; p=0.003) in cases with LUSI. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with apparent stage I endometroid endometrial cancer, the presence of LUSI is a poor prognostic factor, associated with a significantly higher risk of distal recurrence and death. The presence of LUSI warrants consideration when deciding upon surgical staging or postoperative management.<p>

N1-Aryl(heteroaryl)alkyl-N2-[3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propyl]guanidines are potent histamine H2-receptor (H2R) agonists, but their applicability is compromised by the lack of oral bioavailability and CNS penetration. To improve pharmacokinetics, we introduced carbonyl instead of methylene adjacent to the guanidine moiety, decreasing the basicity of the novel H2R agonists by 4-5 orders of magnitude. Some acylguanidines with one phenyl ring were even more potent than their diaryl analogues. As demonstrated by HPLC-MS, the acylguanidines (bioisosteres of the alkylguanidines) were absorbed from the gut of mice and detected in brain. In GTPase assays using recombinant receptors, acylguanidines were more potent at the guinea pig than at the human H2R. At the hH1R and hH3R, the compounds were weak to moderate antagonists or partial agonists. Moreover, potent partial hH4R agonists were identified. Receptor subtype selectivity depends on the imidazolylpropylguanidine moiety (privileged structure), opening an avenue to distinct pharmacological tools including potent H4R agonists.<p>

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the association between glucose infusion during intermittent physical exercise and its metabolic effects on rats. DESIGN: Forty male rats were divided into eight groups based on training (intermittent), exercise and carbohydrate intake (glucose 20%): TEC (trained exercised with carbohydrate), TES (trained exercised without carbohydrate), TNC (trained non-exercised with carbohydrate), TNS (trained non-exercised without carbohydrate), UEC (untrained exercised with carbohydrate), UES (untrained exercised without carbohydrate), UNC (untrained non-exercised with carbohydrate) and UNS (untrained non-exercised without carbohydrate). The training and/or exercise protocol consisted of the rats running on a treadmill for 1 min above the lactate threshold, or running below the lactate threshold for 30s, intermittently for 30 min. Blood was analyzed for glycemia, lactate and IGF-1. Muscle and liver glycogen were measured (T2). RESULTS: Glycemia was found to be different in T2 compared to T1 in the TEC, TNC, UEC and UNC groups. Lactate was higher in T2 than in T1, but remained within the lactate threshold. Glycogen showed higher concentrations in the trained groups and, whether trained or not, in the supplemented groups. IGF-1 levels were higher in exercised rats independent of supplementation or glycogen levels. Trained rats showed lower IGF-1 when exercising than did the untrained animals. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that intermittent exercise is beneficial in preventing a trained lactate pool, and that, in association with glucose supplementation, intermittent exercise will be efficient both in preventing a trained lactate pool and in maintaining sufficient glycemia levels. Exercise raises IGF-1 levels, whereas training inverts this relationship.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcome of preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-A) using their own oocytes in patients with mosaic Turner Syndrome (MTS). The impact of the assisted reproduction technique (ART) performed (PGT-A or oocyte donation) and the type of absence of the X chromosome (total or partial) were considered. DESIGN: Retrospective observational multicenter study. SETTING: University-affiliated private in vitro fertilization center. PATIENT(S): Fifty-six patients with MTS with whom 65 ovarian stimulation cycles for PGT-A (fluorescence in situ hybridization/arrays-next generation sequencing) were performed. The study included 90 women with MTS and 20 women with pure Turner Syndrome (PTS) who underwent 140 and 25 oocyte donation (OD) cycles, respectively. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro fertilization for PGT-A (fluorescence in situ hybridization/arrays-next generation sequencing) or OD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE (S): Reproductive outcome and feto-maternal outcomes. RESULTS: The live birth rate (LBR) per embryo transfer in patients with MTS tended to be higher in OD 37.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.3-46.1) than that observed for PGT-A 22.5% (95% CI 7.8-38.2), and the cumulative LBR (CLBR), with 77.6% vs. 43.3%, respectively. Likewise, the LBR per patient was significant when comparing PGT-A vs. OD, with 12.5% (95 CI 3.9-21.1) vs. 51.1% (40.7-61.4), respectively. While focusing on the X chromosome, partial MTS (PTS), we found significant differences in the CLBR per embryo transfer, with 77.6% vs. 29.2%, and also in the LBR per patient: 51.1% (40.7-61.4) in MTS vs. 15% (95 CI 0.0-30.1) in PTS. CONCLUSION(S): Oocyte donation is the best reproductive option in females with Turner Syndrome with or without mosaicisms. Nevertheless, PGT-A is a valid therapeutic option in patients with MTS using their own oocytes, and OD should not necessarily be directly recommended.<p>

Vitellogenesis in the stick insect Carausius morosus (Br.) has been studied with the goal of identifying vitellogenin in various tissues. Following exposure to in vivo to radioactive amino acids, oocytes in the medium size range are labelled with a minimum delay of 6 h after the time of injection. Incorporation of radioactivity under these conditions is shown to depend upon accumulation of proteins rather than on a differential rate of protein synthesis in succeeding stages of oogenesis. By immunochemical analyses, it is shown that at least two antigens are common to both haemolymph and ovary and that one of these is also present in the fat body. Both antigens are labelled during exposure to radioactive amino acids. When analysed by the SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, extracts from both haemolymph and ovary appear to share a number of protein fractions which range in molecular weight from 40 000 to 200 000 Daltons. The labelling pattern exhibited by these fractions is clearly indicative of a protein transfer from the fat body to the oocyte. Fat body cultured in vivo for up to 4 h releases a major macromolecular complex in the external medium. The latter has been identified as vitellogenin by both immuno-precipitation assay and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein which is synthesized and secreted under these conditions results from the processing of a protein complex of higher molecular weight.<p>

The insect circulatory system transports nutrients, signaling molecules, wastes and immune factors to all areas of the body. The primary organ driving circulation is the dorsal vessel, which consists of an abdominal heart and a thoracic aorta. Here, we present qualitative and quantitative data characterizing the heart of the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. Visual observation showed that the heart of resting mosquitoes contracts at a rate of 1.37 Hz (82 beats per minute) and switches contraction direction, with 72% of contractions occurring in the anterograde direction (toward the head) and 28% of contractions occurring in the retrograde direction (toward the tip of the abdomen). The heart is tethered to the midline of the abdominal tergum by six complete and three incomplete pairs of alary muscles, and propels hemolymph at an average velocity of 8 mm s(-1) by sequentially contracting muscle fibers oriented in a helical twist with respect to the lumen of the vessel. Hemolymph enters the heart through six pairs of incurrent abdominal ostia and one pair of ostia located at the thoraco-abdominal junction that receive hemolymph from the abdominal hemocoel and thoracic venous channels, respectively. The vessel expels hemolymph through distal excurrent openings located at the anterior end of the aorta and the posterior end of the heart. In conclusion, this study presents a comprehensive revision and expansion of our knowledge of the mosquito heart and for the first time quantifies hemolymph flow in an insect while observing dorsal vessel contractions.<p>

Preoligodendrocytes have been described in cultures and tissue prints of adult human white matter (Armstrong et al., 1992). To characterize further these precursors of human oligodendrocytes, we have investigated whether they express genes playing a critical role in oligodendrocyte development. In the intact human brain, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGF alpha R) and myelin transcription factor 1 (MyTI) transcripts are expressed in 1-2% of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage (OL), and clusters of such cells can be found in the periventricular region. Myelin basic protein transcripts containing exon 2 information (exon 2+ MBP), which are characteristic of the premyelinating stage, are detected in 15-20% of OL cells in vivo. When OL cells are separated from human white matter and allowed to regenerate in vitro, a much larger proportion of these cells express developmentally regulated genes, while exon 2- MBP and proteolipid protein (PLP) transcripts characteristic of mature OL cells appear transiently downregulated. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), even in the presence of PDGF, does not promote DNA synthesis in these cultured OL cells. Yet bFGF induces human oligodendrocytes to regenerate their processes rapidly in vitro and to express O4 antigens as well as exon 2+ MBP, MyTI, and PLP transcripts. While bFGF accelerates early regenerative processes, it also maintains high expression of exon 2+ MBP transcripts in OL cells for up to 2 weeks in vitro. In contrast, high levels of insulin in the absence of bFGF allow accumulation of exon 2- MBP and PLP transcripts in most OL cells at 2-3 weeks in vitro. We propose that the myelinated human brain harbors a small pool of precursors of oligodendrocytes and that growth factor-regulated phenotypic plasticity rather than mitogenic potential accounts for the regeneration of oligodendrocytes in the initial stages of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.<p>

Tyrosinase is a type 3 copper enzyme with great potential for production of commercially valuable diphenols from monophenols. However, the use of tyrosinase is limited by its further oxidation of diphenols to quinones. We recently determined the structure of the Bacillus megaterium tyrosinase revealing a residue, V218, which we proposed to take part in positioning of substrates within the active site. In the structure of catechol oxidase from Ipomoea batatas, the lack of monophenolase activity was attributed to the presence of F261 near CuA. Consequently, we engineered two variants, V218F and V218G. V218F was expected to have a decreased monophenolase activity, due to the bulky residue extending into the active site. Surprisingly, both V218F and V218G exhibited a 9- and 4.4-fold higher monophenolase/diphenolase activity ratio, respectively. X-ray structures of variant V218F display a flexibility of the phenylalanine residue along with an adjacent histidine, which we propose to be the source of the change in activity ratio.<p>

We have studied the relation between permeation and recovery from N-type or ball-and-chain inactivation of ShakerB K channels. The channels were expressed in the insect cell line Sf9, by infection with a recombinant baculovirus, and studied under whole cell patch clamp. Recovery from inactivation occurs in two phases. The faster of the two lasts for approximately 200 ms and is followed by a slow phase that may require seconds for completion. The fast phase is enhanced by both permeant ions (K+, Rb+) and by the blocking ion Cs+, whereas the impermeant ions (Na+, Tris+, choline+) are ineffective. The relative potencies are K+ &gt; Rb+ &gt; Cs+ &gt; NH4+ &gt;&gt; Na+ approximately choline+ approximately Tris+. Ion permeation through the channels is not essential for recovery. The results suggest that cations influence the fast phase of recovery by binding in a site with an electrical distance greater than 0.5. Recovery from fast inactivation is voltage-dependent. With Na+, choline+, or Tris+ outside, about 15% of the channels recover in the fast phase (-80 mV), and the other 85% apparently enter a second inactivated state from which recovery is very slow. Recovery in this phase is not influenced by external ions, but is speeded by hyperpolarization.<p>

Ryan &amp; Connell (1989) have demonstrated that different types of behavioural regulation can be located on a continuum of perceived autonomy or perceived locus of causality. The present study applied their formulation in the context of school physical education (PE) and examined the relationships of perceived autonomy, perceived competence and goal orientations with intrinsic interest across two PE activities. School students aged 12-14 years (N = 85) completed an adapted version of the Self-Regulation Questionnaire (Ryan &amp; Connell, 1989) and measures of perceived competence and intrinsic interest separately for two PE activities. They also completed the British version of the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (Duda, Fox, Biddle &amp; Armstrong, 1992). Students appeared to be differentially motivated for the two activities due to different perceptions of autonomy. Structural equation modelling analysis showed that perceived autonomy and task orientation had direct effects on intrinsic interest for both the activities. Perceived competence, however, was positively associated with intrinsic interest only for one of the activities. The implications of the results for the practice of physical education are discussed.<p>

Ultraviolet B (UVB) light is known to be immunosuppressive, but, probably because of a small UVC component in the emission spectra of some of the UVB lamps used, reports vary on effective dose levels. To prevent potentially lethal graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, alloreactive donor T-cell activity must be suppressed. In this study, a narrow wavelength UVB lamp (TL01, 312 nm peak emission) was used to determine what doses of UVB were required to abolish rat lymphocyte proliferation while simultaneously preserving rat bone marrow progenitor cell and primitive hematopoietic stem cell viability. Lymphocyte proliferation, as measured by 3H-Thymidine incorporation, in response to lectin stimulation was abolished below detection at doses greater than 3,500 J/m2. When T-cell clonogenicity was measured in a limiting dilution assay, a small fraction (0.6%) was maintained at doses up to 4,000 J/m2. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity was reduced after treatment with 4,000 J/m2, but a significant level of cytotoxicity was still maintained. Natural killer cell cytolytic activity was not affected by doses up to 4,000 J/m2. At 4,000 J+m2 there was a 10% survival of colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage; a 1% and 4% survival of day-8 and day-12 colony-forming units-spleen, respectively; and 11% survival of marrow repopulating ability cells. Up to 25% of late cobblestone area forming cells (4 to 5 weeks), reflecting the more immature hematopoietic stem cells, were preserved in bone marrow treated with 4,000 J/m2, indicating that early stem cells are less sensitive to UVB damage than are more committed progenitor cells. Thus, a potential therapeutic window was established at approximately 4,000 J/m2 using this light source, whereby the potentially GVHD-inducing T cells were suppressed, but a sufficient proportion of the cells responsible for engraftment was maintained.<p>

The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the effect of pneumatic tourniquet use during arthroscopic meniscectomy on postoperative recovery of quadriceps and hamstring strength. Thirty-four patients with no ligamentous instability underwent arthroscopic meniscectomy after random assignment to the tourniquet or no tourniquet group. Tourniquet pressure was determined with a nomogram that considered thigh circumference and systolic blood pressure at time of induction. Quadriceps and hamstring strengths were tested preoperatively and at 1 week and 4 weeks postoperatively on a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer and expressed as a percentage of the uninvolved side. No significant differences in quadriceps or hamstring strength were noted between groups at any time periods. The findings of this study indicate that recovery of quadriceps and hamstring strength after arthroscopic meniscectomy is not adversely affected by tourniquet use if tourniquet times and pressures are carefully controlled.<p>

PURPOSE: To determine whether the amount of television (TV) watched by participants enrolled in a physical activity intervention mediates or moderates program effectiveness. DESIGN: Nine-month, controlled, school-based physical activity intervention. SETTING: Public high school. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred twenty-two sedentary adolescent females (mean +/- standard deviation age = 15.04 +/- 0.79 years). INTERVENTION: Supervised in-class exercise, health education, and internet-based self-monitoring. MEASURES: Physical activity by 3-day physical activity recall; TV viewing by self-reports; cardiovascular fitness by cycle ergometer. ANALYSIS: T-tests were conducted to examine between-group differences. Linear regression equations tested the mediating or moderating role of TV watching relative to the intervention. RESULTS: TV viewing moderated the intervention's effect on vigorous activity; the intervention significantly predicted change in physical activity among high (beta = -.45; p &lt; .001), but not among low (p &gt; .05), TV watchers. TV viewing did not mediate the intervention effect. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with displacement theory, adolescents who watched more TV prior to the intervention showed postintervention increases in vigorous physical activity and concomitant decreases in TV viewing, whereas those who watched less TV showed no change in physical activity or TV viewing.<p>

Synchrotron x-ray scattering measurements were performed on dilute solutions of the purified hemocyanin subunit (Bsin1) from scorpion (Buthus sindicus) and the N-terminal functional unit (Rta) from a marine snail (Rapana thomasiana). The model-independent approach based on spherical harmonics was applied to calculate the molecular envelopes directly from the scattering profiles. Their molecular shapes in solution could be restored at 2-nm resolution. We show that these units represent stable, globular building blocks of the two hemocyanin families and emphasize their conformational differences on a subunit level. Because no crystallographic or electron microscopy data are available for isolated functional units, this study provides for the first time structural information for isolated, monomeric functional subunits from both hemocyanin families. This has been made possible through the use of low protein concentrations (&lt; or = 1 mg/ml). The observed structural differences may offer advantages in building very different overall molecular architectures of hemocyanin by the two phyla.<p>

158 patients with endometrial cancer who were treated between 1980-1990 at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hospital Berlin-Buch, were reviewed retrospectively with regard to prognostical and therapeutical aspects. The 5-year-survival rate of all patients amounted to 84%. The 5-year-survivals were 92.6% for stage I, 87.5% for stage II and 47.6% for stage III (old FIGO classification). Depth of myometrial invasion, lymph-vascular space involvement, lymph-nodal status, tumor type and grading are of dominant prognostic value. Surgery was the treatment of choice in all reviewed cases. No statistically significant difference was observed in the 5-year survival rate between vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy. The 5-year survival rate for cases with vaginal hysterectomy was 85.4% and for abdominal hysterectomy 87.8%.<p>

Information processing in working memory was investigated in a paradigm with a pseudo-random sequence of visually presented consonants. The subjects' task was to memorize seven sequentially presented letters per trial and to recall the sequence (MEMORY task). Even-related potentials (ERPs) were selectively averaged for each of the seven positions of consonant presentation within a trial. The later a consonant was presented within a trial the smaller the P300 amplitude elicited by the consonant. The number of recall errors increased, however, from first to last presentation position. In a control task identical to the MEMORY condition consonant were presented. To limit the working memory load to one element, subjects had to count the number of letters within trials showing a specific physical criteria. P300 amplitude did not depend on presentation position. P300 was shown to covary with the amount of processing resources available for a task. We assume that increasing working memory load consumes processing resources that are not available for the processing of the incoming stimuli presented later in the trial.<p>

Sterols and sphingolipids are limited to eukaryotic cells, and their interaction has been proposed to favor formation of lipid microdomains. Although there is abundant biophysical evidence demonstrating their interaction in simple systems, convincing evidence is lacking to show that they function together in cells. Using lipid analysis by mass spectrometry and a genetic approach on mutants in sterol metabolism, we show that cells adjust their membrane composition in response to mutant sterol structures preferentially by changing their sphingolipid composition. Systematic combination of mutations in sterol biosynthesis with mutants in sphingolipid hydroxylation and head group turnover give a large number of synthetic and suppression phenotypes. Our unbiased approach provides compelling evidence that sterols and sphingolipids function together in cells. We were not able to correlate any cellular phenotype we measured with plasma membrane fluidity as measured using fluorescence anisotropy. This questions whether the increase in liquid order phases that can be induced by sterol-sphingolipid interactions plays an important role in cells. Our data revealing that cells have a mechanism to sense the quality of their membrane sterol composition has led us to suggest that proteins might recognize sterol-sphingolipid complexes and to hypothesize the coevolution of sterols and sphingolipids.<p>

For good function, membrane lipids have to be arranged appropriately and be in the correct physical state. In poikilotherms, exposure to cold stress or heat shock can alter membrane properties such that, unless they are corrected quickly, damage and, possibly, death can result. Low temperature stress is countered by modifying membrane lipids such that their average transition temperature is lowered. There are various ways in which this can be achieved but an increase in fatty acid unsaturation is the most common. For heat shock, various changes in lipids have been noted and some defensive strategies involving heat shock proteins noted. In this short review, we will describe recent results where adaptive lipid changes, as a result of temperature stress, have been found. Mechanisms for bringing about such alterations are discussed, together with the contrasting data for different organisms.<p>

In a collaborative work carried out by the Spanish and Portuguese ISFG Working Group (GEP-ISFG), a polymerase chain reaction multiplex was optimized in order to type ten X-chromosome short tandem repeats (STRs) in a single reaction, including: DXS8378, DXS9902, DXS7132, DXS9898, DXS6809, DXS6789, DXS7133, GATA172D05, GATA31E08, and DXS7423. Using this X-decaplex, each 17 of the participating laboratories typed a population sample of approximately 200 unrelated individuals (100 males and 100 females). In this work, we report the allele frequencies for the ten X-STRs in 15 samples from Argentina (Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Rio Negro, Entre Rios, and Misiones), Brazil (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Parana, and Mato Grosso do Sul), Colombia (Antioquia), Costa Rica, Portugal (Northern and Central regions), and Spain (Galicia and Cantabria). Gene diversities were calculated for the ten markers in each population and all values were above 56%. The average diversity per locus varied between 66%, for DXS7133, and 82%, for DXS6809. For this set of STRs, a high discrimination power was obtained in all populations, both in males (&gt; or =1 in 5 x 10(5)) and females (&gt; or =1 in 3 x 10(9)), as well as high mean exclusion chance in father/daughter duos (&gt; or =99.953%) and in father/mother/daughter trios (&gt; or =99.999%). Genetic distance analysis showed no significant differences between northern and central Portugal or between the two Spanish samples from Galicia and Cantabria. Inside Brazil, significant differences were found between Rio de Janeiro and the other three populations, as well as between Sao Paulo and Parana. For the five Argentinean samples, significant distances were only observed when comparing Misiones with Entre Rios and with Rio Negro, the only two samples that do not differ significantly from Costa Rica. Antioquia differed from all other samples, except the one from Rio Negro.<p>

Gutierrez, E., et al. (2007). &quot;Specialized hepatocyte-like cells regulate Drosophila lipid metabolism.&quot; <u>Nature</u> <b>445</b>(7125): 275-280.<p>
Lipid metabolism is essential for growth and generates much of the energy needed during periods of starvation. In Drosophila, fasting larvae release large quantities of lipid from the fat body but it is unclear how and where this is processed. Here we identify the oenocyte as the principal cell type accumulating lipid droplets during starvation. Tissue-specific manipulations of the Slimfast amino-acid channel, the Lsd2 fat-storage regulator and the Brummer lipase indicate that oenocytes act downstream of the fat body. In turn, oenocytes are required for depleting stored lipid from the fat body during fasting. Hence, lipid-metabolic coupling between the fat body and oenocytes is bidirectional. When food is plentiful, oenocytes have critical roles in regulating growth, development and feeding behaviour. In addition, they specifically express many different lipid-metabolizing proteins, including Cyp4g1, an omega-hydroxylase regulating triacylglycerol composition. These findings provide evidence that some lipid-processing functions of the mammalian liver are performed in insects by oenocytes.<p>

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that desmoteplase, a novel plasminogen activator, has clinical benefit when given 3-9 h after the onset of the symptoms of stroke in patients with presumptive tissue at risk that is identified by magnetic resonance perfusion imaging (PI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). METHODS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study, patients with acute ischaemic stroke and tissue at risk seen on either MRI or CT imaging were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to 90 microg/kg desmoteplase, 125 microg/kg desmoteplase, or placebo within 3-9 h after the onset of symptoms of stroke. The primary endpoint was clinical response rates at day 90, defined as a composite of improvement in National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) score of 8 points or more or an NIHSS score of 1 point or less, a modified Rankin scale score of 0-2 points, and a Barthel index of 75-100. Secondary endpoints included change in lesion volume between baseline and day 30, rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, and mortality rates. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00111852. FINDINGS: Between June, 2005, and March, 2007, 193 patients were randomised, and 186 patients received treatment: 57 received 90 microg/kg desmoteplase; 66 received 125 microg/kg desmoteplase; and 63 received placebo. 158 patients completed the study. The median baseline NIHSS score was 9 (IQR 6-14) points, and 30% (53 of 179) of the patients had a visible occlusion of a vessel at presentation. The core lesion and the mismatch volumes were small (median volumes were 10.6 cm(3) and 52.5 cm(3), respectively). The clinical response rates at day 90 were 47% (27 of 57) for 90 microg/kg desmoteplase, 36% (24 of 66) for 125 microg/kg desmoteplase, and 46% (29 of 63) for placebo. The median changes in lesion volume were: 90 microg/kg desmoteplase 14.0% (0.5 cm(3)); 125 microg/kg desmoteplase 10.8% (0.3 cm(3)); placebo -10.0% (-0.9 cm(3)). The rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage were 3.5% (2 of 57) for 90 microg/kg desmoteplase, 4.5% (3 of 66) for 125 microg/kg desmoteplase, and 0% for placebo. The overall mortality rate was 11% (5% [3 of 57] for 90 microg/kg desmoteplase; 21% [14 of 66] for 125 microg/kg desmoteplase; and 6% [4 of 63] for placebo). INTERPRETATION: The DIAS-2 study did not show a benefit of desmoteplase given 3-9 h after the onset of stroke. The high response rate in the placebo group could be explained by the mild strokes recorded (low baseline NIHSS scores, small core lesions, and small mismatch volumes that were associated with no vessel occlusions), which possibly reduced the potential to detect any effect of desmoteplase.

Seminal plasma derived factors are implicated in mediating inflammation in the female reproductive tract following insemination at mating. During inflammation, leukocytes are activated to express adhesion receptors resulting in adherence to each other and for the ECM as well as for various cell types. The present study describes the purification of a leukocyte cell-cell adhesion regulator derived from seminal vesicle fluid. Seminal vesicle fluid proteins were chromatographed by cation exchange, hydrophobic interaction and reversed phase. Chromatography on Phenyl Superose resolved two distinct forms of cell-cell adhesion regulation, type I and II. Reversed phase chromatography of fractions inducing type I adhesion resulted in the isolation of a 15kDa adhesion inducing protein (pAIF-1). The N-terminal sequence contained a hydrophobic consensus sequence which exists in: two bovine seminal vesicle proteins (BSPA3, PDC 109); IGF-II receptor; fibronectin; and the cation independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor.<p>

The development of the purification process for VAQTA, which results in a highly purified inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, was driven by modifications in the cell-culture and harvest methods which permit hepatitis A virus propagation to support large-scale manufacture. The starting material for the purification was initially a concentrated cell pellet scraped from roller bottles. However, when the cell-culture method was scaled up to use high-surface-area Nunc cell factories or Costar cubes, the early steps in the process had to be modified to handle large volumes of dilute lysate. Membrane concentration was used at first, and a highly purified vaccine was prepared, but virus-poly(nucleic acid) complexes were formed, which reduced the yields in later processing steps. The introduction of a nuclease digestion immediately after harvest followed by capture chromatography on an anion-exchange column eliminated the formation of these complexes and resulted in more consistent performance and higher yields of downstream operations.<p>

Poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation has been successfully used to concentrate and purify hepatitis A virus from crude lysate preparations for production of VAQTA, a highly purified, formalin-inactivated hepatitis A vaccine. Initial results showed that nucleic acids present in the starting material were problematic for the performance of the poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation step. Extensive experiments were carried out to identify processing conditions suitable for vaccine manufacture which would enhance product yield and improve purity. Results of these studies indicated that the earlier practice of concentrating crude virus-containing lysate using semipermeable membranes led to aggregation of high molecular weight nucleic acids. This aggregated material coprecipitated with the virus during the subsequent poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation step; variable amounts of nucleic acids led to inconsistent virus recovery and product purity. Nuclease treatment of the crude lysate preparations decreased the molecular size of the nucleic acids and significantly reduced their coprecipitation with the virus. Further experiments demonstrated that optimal placement of the nuclease treatment was at the lysate stage followed by a capture step using anion exchange chromatography. These steps combined with optimization of the virus concentration, ionic strength, and pH of the poly(ethylene glycol) precipitation led to effective and selective concentration of the virus which significantly enhanced process reproducibility and control.<p>

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are diagnostic markers for systemic vasculitis. They are classically detected by an indirect immunofluorescence test using normal donor neutrophils as substrate. This assay lacks antigenic specificity and is not quantitative. The 'EC/BCR Project for ANCA Assay Standardization' is an international collaboration study with the aim to develop and standardize solid phase assays for ANCA detection. In this part of the study the isolation and characterization of proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase, the two main target molecules for ANCA, and the development and standardization of ELISAs with these antigens are described. Six laboratories successfully isolated purified proteinase-3 preparations that could be used. Three of these preparations, together with one myeloperoxidase preparation, were subsequently used for ANCA testing by ELISA. The ELISA technique was standardized in two rounds of testing in the 14 participating laboratories. The coefficient of variation of these new assays decreased from values of approx. 50% in the first round to approx. 20% in the second round. We conclude that purified proteinase-3 and myeloperoxidase can be used in standardized ELISAs for ANCA detection. Whether such procedures offer advantages over the IIF test will be determined in a prospective clinical study.<p>

Farming of the ostrich--a non domesticated species--cannot be done species-conforming; it is even a cruelty to the animals. Keeping in captivity leads to a steady rank order stress; the biology of their reproduction is heavily impaired and their typical moving requirements can only be poorly satisfied. The specific habit of food intake cannot be performed accordingly, and the early deprivation, caused by the absence of parents during the weanling period, creates extremely abnormal behaviour. Summing up, all these deficiencies constitute the fact of cruelty to animals according to the German Animal Protection Act.<p>

A method for separating and detecting retinoids by reversed-phase capillary liquid chromatography with amperometric electrochemical detection is described. Packed columns with an inner diameter of 180 microns were employed for the separation using C18 stationary phase and a mobile phase containing acetonitrile-water methanol (65:32.5:2.5, v/v/v) with 1% tetrabutylammonium perchlorate and 0.174 M acetate buffered at pH 5. The detection cell consisted of a carbon fiber barrel electrode held at 0.9 V versus an Ag/AgCl reference. Injection volumes of 2 microliters produced detection limits of 2.73, 0.472, 0.428, and 0.267 fmol (or 410, 64.1, 60.9, and 38.2 pg ml-1) for 13-cis-retinoic acid, all-trans-retinoic acid, retinaldehyde, and retinol, respectively. This represents an improvement in detection limits of at least three orders of magnitude for similar analyses using liquid chromatography and UV absorbance detection. The detector signal was linear over two orders of magnitude of analyte concentration. Retinoid concentrations in bovine serum were determined and found to be in good agreement with previously reported values.<p>

Epifluorescence microscopy has been used previously to study coexisting liquid phases in lipid monolayers of dihydrocholesterol and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine at the air/water interface. This binary mixture has a critical point at room temperature (22 degrees C), a monolayer pressure of approx. 10 mN/m, and a composition in the vicinity of 20-30 mol% dihydrocholesterol. It is reported here that this critical pressure can be lowered, raised, or maintained constant by systematically replacing molecules of this phosphatidylcholine with molecules of a phosphatidylethanolamine, or an unsaturated phosphatidylcholine, or mixtures of the two, while maintaining the dihydrocholesterol concentration at 20 mol%. Thus, even complex mixtures of lipids may be characterized by a single, well-defined second-order phase transition. In principle, such transitions might be found in biological membranes.<p>

Health care delivery systems must address the sometimes conflicting expectations of its stakeholders. The people who pay for the service or a set of benefits are not always the people who receive the service. The challenge is to meet the expectations of the patient for high quality and to meet the expectations of the employer and/or insurance plan for low costs. We are no longer managing just quality. We are managing the total value of service from the perspective of out stakeholders. Stakeholder satisfaction is defined as achieving or exceeding the stakeholder's expectations from the resources committed. An operational definition of value is useful in helping administrators and physicians to focus on the interactions of the key management variables of cost, effectiveness, efficiency and access. The development of decision models based on these key variables is a helpful tool for quantifying the value of the decision from the perspective of each stakeholder.<p>

Marine Beggiatoa strains MS-81-6 and MS-81-1c are filamentous gliding bacteria that use hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate as electron donors for chemolithotrophic energy generation. They are known to be capable of chemolithoautotrophic growth in sulfide gradient media; here we report the first successful bulk cultivation of these strains in a defined liquid medium. To investigate their nutritional versatilities, strains MS-81-6 and MS-81-1c were grown in sulfide-oxygen gradient media supplemented with single organic compounds. Respiration rates and biomass production relative to those of controls grown in unsupplemented sulfide-limited media were monitored to determine whether organic compounds were utilized as sources of energy and/or cell carbon. With cells grown in sulfide gradient and liquid media, we showed that strain MS-81-6 strongly regulates two enzymes, the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and the Calvin cycle enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, in response to the presence of organic carbon (acetate) in the growth medium. In contrast, strain MS-81-1c lacked 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activity and regulated ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity only slightly in response to organic substrates. Tracer experiments with radiolabeled acetate showed that strain MS-81-1c did not oxidize acetate to CO(inf2) but could synthesize approximately 20% of its cell carbon from acetate. On the basis of these results, we conclude that Beggiatoa strain MS-81-1c is an obligate chemolithoautotroph, while strain MS-81-6 is a versatile facultative chemolithoautotroph.<p>

In patients with metastatic breast cancer, cure is almost always an exception, irrespective of the therapy given. Thus the preservation of the quality of life or palliation in case of symptoms must be the principal goal. Only a small group of patients with their tumour showing a highly aggressive behaviour should be considered for primary chemotherapy. Aggressive tumour growth is then characterized by negative hormonal receptors, short disease-free interval and predominant visceral tumour growth. For all other patients there is not enough advantage to justify the clearly higher toxicity of a primary chemotherapy. This majority of patients with metastatic breast cancer can profit to a higher degree from hormonal treatment. Irrespective of the type of the hormonal therapy, the response rate is positively correlated with postmenopausal status, high hormonal receptor expression, al long disease-free interval, no previous adjuvant therapy and higher age. Advantages and problems of the various forms of hormonal manipulations are discussed. The recommended sequence of therapy represents only a handrail that needs to be adjusted carefully, according to the individual situation, the needs and expectations of the patient and in due knowledge of the toxicity of each hormonal substance. Combinations of different hormonal agents do not yield an additional benefit and should therefore be dropped for a sequential approach.<p>

Little is known about the population processes that shape the genetic diversity in natural populations of rhizobia. A sample of 912 Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii isolates were collected from naturalized red clover populations (Trifolium pratense) and analysed for 15 allozyme loci to determine the levels and distribution of genetic diversity. Hierarchical analyses compared different sampling levels, geographical separation, and temporal separation. Total genetic diversity across all isolates was H = 0.426, with 57.6% of the total diversity found among isolates obtained from individual red clover plants. Relatively low genetic differentiation among populations and high differentiation among plants within populations was observed; this suggests that gene flow and founder effect act differently at geographical and local scales. Significant differences were observed in (i) allele frequencies among populations and among plants within populations, and (ii) the frequency distribution of the most widespread and the most abundant strains. When multilocus linkage disequilibrium was calculated, significant levels of disequilibrium were observed in the total sample and in three of the eight populations.<p>

In our laryngology practice, we have noted an increasing number of elderly patients referred to us for problematic dysphonia. We present our findings of the most common disorder affecting this age group. A sample of 47 consecutive patients over age 60 with dysphonia revealed presbylaryngis, ie, age-related anatomic and physiologic changes, as the most common etiology found in this tertiary referral practice, accounting for 30% (14 patients) of new diagnoses. None of the patients with presbylaryngis received this diagnosis from the referral source. Understanding the anatomic and physiologic changes of the aging vocal tract, along with the clinical correlation of each change, is crucial in evaluating this group of patients. Managing this disorder includes specific goal-oriented speech therapy, with surgery as an adjunct should conservative therapy prove unsuccessful. Earlier recognition of this disorder and prompt intervention are key factors in reversing vocal decompensation, with a primary effect of improving the quality of life for the patient with age-related dysphonia.<p>

Two thyroid hormone response elements (TREs), designated A1 TRE (-295/-268) and B1 TRE (+207/+227), have been identified within the Purkinje cell-expressed Pcp-2 gene. Previous studies have characterized the A1 TRE (Zou et al., 1994). This article analyzes the structural and functional characteristics of the intronic B1 TRE. The B1 sequence contains four overlapping TRE half-sites. The 3' DR4 motif, consisting of the second and forth half-sites, is responsible for the T3 induction observed with the B1 sequence. Gel-shift analysis reveals developmentally regulated complexes that are abundant in the fetus and at birth and then fall precipitously in the neonate bind to B1. The observed time-course of these complexes varies inversely with the rise in Pcp-2 expression, thus raising the possibility that the complexes may represent inhibitory factors. Supershift analysis indicates that endogenous TR alpha 1 is present in the fetal nuclear protein complexes that bind to B1. Competition analysis also indicates the second B1 TRE half-site is important in binding the TR alpha 1-TRAP complexes. These studies suggest that the B1 sequence may bind potential TR alpha 1-TRAP repressor complexes in the fetus, whereas in the neonate, these TRE sites may be involved in the activation of Pcp-2 by binding other TR-TRAP-activating complexes.<p>

How fast can a protein fold? The rate of polypeptide collapse to a compact state sets an upper limit to the rate of folding. Collapse may in turn be limited by the rate of intrachain diffusion. To address this question, we have determined the rate at which two regions of an unfolded protein are brought into contact by diffusion. Our nanosecond-resolved spectroscopy shows that under strongly denaturing conditions, regions of unfolded cytochrome separated by approximately 50 residues diffuse together in 35-40 microseconds. This result leads to an estimate of approximately (1 microsecond)-1 as the upper limit for the rate of protein folding.<p>

Dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon. Due to the nonspecific symptomatology, as well as the manifold etiology, clinical diagnosis may be difficult. In these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical CT in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis. In 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis CT angiography was performed. In 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed. In order to acquire also arterial vessels, a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected. By this method we found an occlusion of the MCA in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis. In all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an &quot;empty delta&quot; sign. With irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus. The MIP reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage. In three patients MR angiograms were available for comparison. The smaller veins, such as the v. vermis inferior, were less clearly depicted than in CT angiography. CT angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis. It can be performed immediately after non-enhanced CT. According to our present experience CT angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis.<p>

Photolabile compounds which rapidly release cAMP or cGMP after photolysis are widely used for in situ studies of signaling pathways inside cells. We synthesized two novel caged compounds, 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl 8-Br-cAMP (caged 8-Br-cAMP) and 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl 8-Br-cGMP caged 8-BR-cGMP), which respectively release the hydrolysis-resistant analogues 8-Br-cAMP and 8-Br-cGMP. Their usefulness for physiological studies was examined in a mammalian cell line expressing the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel of bovine olfactory sensory neurons. The synthesis procedure resulted in diastereomeric mixtures which were chromatographically separated into the axial and equatorial isomers of caged 8-BR-cAMP and of caged 8-BR-cGMP. The axial isomers which have a higher solubility and better solvolytic stability than the equatorial forms were used for experiments with CNG channels. Flashes of UV light produced steps in the concentration of 8-Br-cGMP which activated currents through CNG channels. Concentration steps inside the cell could be calibrated precisely using the relation between the ligand concentration and the normalized current. Similar results were obtained with caged 8-Br-cAMP. Control experiments with caged cGMP showed that flash-induced currents decayed within a few minutes because photoreleased cGMP was degraded by endogenous phosphodiesterase activity. The rise time of the 8-Br-cGMP-activated whole-cell current was consistent with a bimolecular reaction between channel and ligand.<p>

Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) is common during sleep in patients with severe congestive heart failure. It is not clear, if there is a relation between CSR and arrhythmias. Therefore in this study the impact of the nocturnal CSR on ventricular arrhythmias and the heart rate, as well as the influence of nasal nocturnal oxygen on CSR and sleep was studied. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study 22 patients were assigned to 1 week each of oxygen and room air. The age of the patients was 57 +/- 10 years. Their mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 18.9 +/- 6.4%. Breathing oxygen significantly reduced the duration of CSR by over 50% (162 +/- 142 vs 88 +/- 106 min, p &lt; 0.05). Sleep did improve as evidenced mainly by less arousals (21 +/- 13 vs 15 +/- 9/h total sleep time; p &lt; 0.05) and stage 1 sleep as well as more stage 2 and slow wave sleep. Nocturnal oxygen resulted in a reduction of ventricular arrhythmias for ventricular ectopic beats (53.1 +/- 157.7 vs 44.7 +/- 97.1/h), couplets (9.0 +/- 38.3 vs 3.7 +/- 14.3/h) and tachycardias (1.8 +/- 7.2 vs 0.4 +/- 0.8/h). Due to the high day-today variability these differences were not significant, but the decrease of average nocturnal heart rate with oxygen was (71 +/- 14 vs 68 +/- 14/min; p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, nocturnal oxygen causes a reduction of CSR, an improvement of sleep and a decrease of arousals. A significant reduction of arrhythmias by nocturnal oxygen could not be proved.<p>

PURPOSE: To investigate the feasibility to use hydroxyethylstarch as an alternative deswelling additive in short-term preservation media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Corneoscleral discs were prepared from pairs of eye balls of freshly slaughtered pigs. Corneas were stored in MEM-medium containing either 10% or 20% hydroxyethylstarch 450 000 at 4 degrees C in a refrigerator. Subsequently, the tissue was stored for 24 hours in organ culture at 37 degrees C in MEM-medium containing 10% fetal calf serum to detect latent endothelial cell damage. Mate corneas were treated the same except for being stored in Optisol GS during 4 degrees C storage. We determined corneal endothelial cell density, stromal thickness, and glucose concentration in the medium directly after preparation, after short-term storage at 4 degrees C, and after subsequent organ culture at 37 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy of corneal endothelium was performed at each step during the experimental course. RESULTS: We did not observe any significant differences in endothelial-cell density between experimental groups and control groups. No decrease in endothelial-cell density was observed during the course of experiments. No increase in stromal thickness was determined in any group after short-term storage at 4 degrees C. Corneas stored in medium containing 20% hydroxyethylstarch showed a decrease in stromal thickness after short-term storage. After subsequent organ culture all corneas displayed a uniform stromal swelling. Glucose concentrations in the media decreased in all groups during the experiment. In scanning-electron microscopy we observed a reversible degeneration of cell borders after storage at 4 degrees C. Additionally, corneas stored in Optisol GS showed a reversible cobblestone appearance at this stage of the experiments. CONCLUSION: Hydroxyethylstarch appears to be an alternative to the use of dextran and chondroitin sulfate as a deswelling additive in corneal preservation media.<p>

Endophthalmitis after penetrating keratoplasty is rare but more frequently observed than after other intraocular procedures. The main source may be a contaminated donor cornea. This survey reviews current concepts of donor globe decontamination and avoidance of infection during preservation. Basically, we suggest the use of a 3% PVP-Iodine solution for decontamination of donor globes. Using short-term preservation techniques, the tissue should be stored at ambient temperature after preparation of corneoscleral disc or before transplantation for a while to allow antibiotics to act against decontaminants. Tissue stored by organ culture should be kept in a sealed vial. Alternatively, the medium may be changed every 10 to 14 days under sterile conditions.<p>

A variety of heritable bone dysplasias have been identified, affecting a total of 3-4.5 in 10,000 new-born individuals. Many of these dysplasias affect fetal growth and growth during infancy, with linear growth and body proportions being affected. Taken together, the effects of such dysplasias often result in a reduced adult height. Currently, radiographic criteria are used to distinguish between different dysplasias. However, additional clinical findings are often required to make a specific diagnosis. Molecular and genetic techniques may also be used to confirm a particular diagnosis. However, the specific genetic defect underlying each disorder has yet to be identified for the majority of disorders.<p>

Sinusoidal (basolateral) bile sale uptake is mediated by Na(+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent transport systems. Two hepatocellular bile salt uptake systems have been cloned from rat and human livers. The Na(+)-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptides Ntcp and NTCP mediate strictly Na(+)-dependent bile salt uptake into rat and human hepatocytes, respectively. Extensive characterization of Ntcp expression and function in a variety of eukaryotic cell lines, cultured hepatocytes, and intact rat liver indicates that Ntcp can account for most, if not all, Na(+)-dependent bile salt transport functions in rat liver. Whether the same is also true for the human NTCP is less well understood. The Na(+)-independent organic anion transporting polypeptides oatpl (rat) and OATP (human) exhibit a wide and charge-independent substrate specificity. Their transported substrates include sulfobromophthalein, bile salts, estrone-3-sulfates, ouabain, and other neutral steroids, as well as certain amphipathic organic cations. Its broad and charge-independent substrate specificity indicates that oatpl represents the previously suggested hepatocellular &quot;multispecific bile salt transporter.&quot;. Oatpl and OATP are also expressed in the kidney and brain. Whether there are additional oatpl- and OATP-related proteins involved in overall hepatic drug and steroid clearance remains to be determined.<p>

A Na(+)-dependent bile acid (Na+/taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; Ntcp) and a Na(+)-independent bromosulphophthalein (BSP)/bile acid uptake system (organic-anion-transporting polypeptide; oatp) have been cloned from rat liver by using functional expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes. To evaluate the extent to which these cloned transporters could account for overall hepatic bile acid and BSP uptake, we used antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of Ntcp and oatp in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with total rat liver mRNA. An Ntcp-specific antisense oligonucleotide co-injected with total rat liver mRNA blocked the expression of Na(+)-dependent taurocholate uptake by approx. 95%. In contrast, an oatp-specific antisense oligonucleotide when co-injected with total rat liver mRNA had no effect on the expression of Na(+)-dependent taurocholate uptake, but it blocked Na(+)-independent uptake of taurocholate by approx. 80% and of BSP by 50%. Assuming similar expression of hepatocellular bile acid and organic anion transporters in Xenopus laevis oocytes, these results indicate that Ntcp and oatp respectively represent the major, if not the only, Na(+)-dependent and Na(+)-independent taurocholate uptake systems in rat liver. By contrast, the cloned oatp accounts for only half of BSP transport, suggesting that there must be additional, non-bile acid transporting organic anion uptake systems in rat liver.<p>

Hagendorf, H. and B. Sa (1996). &quot;Coordination in visual working memory.&quot; <u>Psychological Research</u> <b>58</b>(4): 294-306.<p>
Coordination of mental procedures is considered in terms of control processes (Baddeley, 1989) in visual working memory and appears to be a separable aspect of the demand imposed by cascaded serial processes (Carlson &amp; Lundy, 1992). The main task required subjects to indicate whether symbolically suggested rotations and reflections correctly describe the difference between matrix patterns of filled-in squares within a 3 x 3 grid or between line drawings. Experiments were carried out to show that coordination is a separable component in this transformation task. A marker for coordination is the difference between the time taken to execute two transformations as a whole and the sum of the component transformations in isolation. The separate coordination demand was found in an experiment with matrix patterns mentioned, in an experiment with letter-like line drawings, and also in an experiment that forced subjects to maintain whole-pattern representations. A last experiment checked whether coordination is carried out by an autonomous control unit. There was a self-paced control of serial presentation of transformation symbols instead of a simultaneous presentation of those symbols. This additional external triggering resulted in a substantial decrease in the demand for coordination. Coordination of mental procedures and temporary representations is a fundamental constraint on the use of working-memory processes.<p>

HISTORY: A 26-year-old man sustained a wasp bite 5 years ago which caused arterial embolism to the right brachial artery. Now he again had a wasp bite with allergic reaction and an arterial embolus to the left brachial artery. 2 days later, after embolectomy and heparinisation, he had a cerebrovascular accident due to an embolus to the left internal carotid artery. 15 days later, despite oral anticoagulation (Quick value 10%), he had an embolism to the left femoral artery. INVESTIGATIONS: The source of the emboli was found by echocardiography to be a spherical floating thrombus on the aortic valve. The plasminogen level was only 45-61%. His mother and sister also had a low plasminogen level, i.e. he had congenital plasminogen deficiency. TREATMENT AND COURSE: At surgery, when the thrombus had been removed, a slit-like defect was found on one of the aortic leaflets and covered with a pericardial patch. At first heparin then phenprocoumon were administered, plus 250 mg ticlopidine twice daily. There have been no further complications. CONCLUSION: As the patient's fibrinolysis activity was normal, additional, probably allergic, factors must have been present to disturb the equilibrium between thrombogenesis and fibrinolysis thus causing thrombosis at a predisposed site.<p>

CD3 epsilon and the zeta-chain of the bovine T-cell receptor (TCR) are two invariant molecules with an important role in signal transduction via the TCR/CD3 complex. The nucleotide sequence of a bovine CD3 epsilon cDNA clone containing the complete coding sequence was determined and the deduced amino acid (aa) sequence compared to that of other species. The cytoplasmic domains of the different CD3 epsilon clearly show a higher degree of conservation than the extracellular domains. Bovine CD3 epsilon produced in Escherichia coli using different bacterial expression vectors was recognised by antibodies (Ab) directed against the intracytoplasmic domain of human CD3 epsilon. A partial bovine TCR zeta-chain cDNA was generated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers that were based on sequences that are conserved between different species; 3' and 5' RACE-PCR were carried out to obtain the complete TCR zeta-chain cDNA sequence. A comparison of the predicted TCR zeta-chain aa sequence reveals that the GDP/GTP-binding motif, which is conserved in other species, shows marked differences in the bovine and ovine TCR zeta-chains. In contrast to CD3 epsilon, the short extracellular domain of the TCR zeta-chain is 100% conserved between the different species and the transmembrane domain also shows a high degree of identity. Ab were raised against the TCR zeta-chain, produced as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in E. coli, and were used in Western blot analysis to further characterise TCR zeta-chain expression in T-cells. The regents provide valuable tools for the study of signal transduction pathways in normal and transformed bovine T-cells.<p>

A strain of Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from nitrobenzene-contaminated soil and groundwater on 2-nitrotoluene as the sole source of carbon, energy, and nitrogen. Bacterial cells growing on 2-nitrotoluene released nitrite into the growth medium. The isolate also grew on 3-methylcatechol, 4-methylcatechol, and catechol. 2-Nitrotoluene, 3-methylcatechol, and catechol stimulated oxygen consumption by intact cells regardless of the growth substrate. Crude extracts from the isolate contained catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoate hydrolase activity. The results suggest that 2-nitrotoluene is subject to initial attack by a dioxygenase enzyme that forms 3-methylcatechol with concomitant release of nitrite. The 3-methylcatechol is subsequently degraded via the meta ring fission pathway.<p>

Liposarcoma of the head and neck is rarely reported Orbital and eye lid involvement has been found to be extremely rare. A 25 year old male patient from Harar presented with left eyelid mass of two years duration and diagnosed to have liposarcoma by incisional biopsy. Despite the difficulty in obtaining wide surgical margins, the small tumor size at presentation and the apparent predominance of well-differentiated type means that the prognosis for orbital liposarcoma was generally good. The epidemiological, clinical feature and histological findings are discussed. It is recommended to consider liposarcoma as a differential diagnosis of orbital mass lesions.<p>

Capacity to repair UV-induced DNA damage was studied by use of host cell reactivation assay in T lymphocytes isolated from 86 cases and 87 controls (aged 44-68 years) who were participants in a population-based case-control study of basal cell (BCC) or squamous cell (SCC) carcinoma of the skin in Geraldton, Western Australia. Lymphocytes were cultured and transfected with either control or UV-irradiated plasmids (254 nm, 350 J/m2) containing a reporter gene [the chloramphenicol-acetyltransferase (CAT) gene], and the repair capacity was determined by measuring CAT gene expression in protein extracts prepared from the transfected cells. DNA repair activity was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.94-1.26) times greater in BCC cases than in controls for each 350 J/m2 increment in UV dose to the plasmids, and 1.04 (95% confidence interval 0.85-1.26) times greater in SCC cases than in controls, though the differences were not statistically significant. DNA repair activity showed little association with age, sex and viability of the lymphocytes, though it was positively associated with their blastogenic rate (p = 0.055).<p>

BACKGROUND: Focal gliomas involving the midbrain tectum and tegmentum have been identified as having a better prognosis than diffuse tumors affecting the brain stem. However, only limited information is available concerning treatment effectiveness and long term outcome for these patients. METHODS: A retrospective, population-based cancer registry survey was performed to assess the clinical features and treatment courses of patients with focal midbrain tumors. RESULTS: Sixteen patients with midbrain gliomas were identified; eight had tectal gliomas and eight tegmental gliomas. Thirteen patients presented with symptoms related to hydrocephalus, and 12 required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Seven patients underwent surgery directed at the tumor. Eight patients underwent initial radiation therapy and none had initial chemotherapy. One patient diagnosed at age 18 months had a rapidly growing tumor after 14 months of follow up which has responded to chemotherapy. The mean survival of this patient population was 84 months (range 3-280 months) after diagnosis, with only one tumor related death occurring (280 months after diagnosis). Survival was not affected by tumor location within the midbrain (tegmental or tectal) or by whether radiation therapy was or was not administered. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with focal midbrain gliomas require symptom control aimed at treatment of hydrocephalus, or mass effect from the tumor. However the extended survival of this population suggests that routine aggressive surgical debulking is often not required. Furthermore, the routine use of radiation therapy or chemotherapy for all such patients is questioned.<p>

The inhibitory action of physiological to pathophysiological serum cortisol levels on TSH secretion were investigated in 12 patients with Addison's disease on 3 occasions. 1) In continuation of the conventional hydrocortisone (HC) substitution, a medium dose of HC (0.5 mg/kg) was infused over 23 h. 2) After 24-h withdrawal of HC, the patients had placebo infusion over 23 h. 3) After 5 days of dexamethasone (1.5 mg/day), a high dose of HC (2.0 mg/kg) was infused over 23 h. Blood sampling was performed every 10 min during the last 10 h of the study period, followed by a TRH test (10 micrograms, iv), To mimic the normal diurnal rhythm for serum cortisol, HC was infused in graduated doses, and during medium dose infusion, the serum cortisol level and the TSH pulsatility pattern were similar to those seen in normal controls. The TSH mean level was 1.0 +/- 0.5 mU/L during medium doses of HC, increasing significantly (P &lt; 0.05) to 2.0 +/- 1.6 mU/L during the low cortisol state and was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) suppressed to 0.4 +/- 0.2 mU/L during high doses of glucocorticoids, when the pulse frequency was also significantly reduced (P &lt; 0.01). Together with a dose-dependent inhibitory action of glucocorticoids on the TSH response to TRH, our data indicate that even physiological serum levels of cortisol have an influence on endogenous TSH secretion, probably caused by regulation of the pituitary sensitivity to TRH.<p>

The sisterhood method is an indirect method of estimating maternal mortality that has, in comparison with conventional direct methods, the dual advantages of ease of use in the field and smaller sample-size requirements. This report describes how to calculate a standard error to quantify the sampling variability for this method. This standard error can be used to construct confidence intervals and statistical tests and to plan the size of a sample survey that employs the sisterhood method. Statistical assumptions are discussed, particularly in relation to the effective sample size and to effects of extrabinomial variation. In a worked example of data from urban Pakistan, a maternal mortality ratio of 153 (95 percent confidence interval between 96 and 212) deaths per 100,000 live births is estimated.<p>

Although breeding of companion birds has become increasingly popular over the last decades, evaluating avian fecundity is rarely addressed and remains a challenge. Whereas histologic examination of a testicular biopsy sample is useful in evaluating reproductive status, as well as in identifying pathologic changes, cytologic examination is a much quicker method and is less invasive. To determine if cytologic examination of testicular impression smears is reliable compared with histologic examination in assessing reproductive status, we evaluated results in 16 live and in 14 dead male budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus). In most birds, macroscopic evaluation, combined with histologic or cytologic examination, resulted in a consistent grading of testicular reproductive stage. However, some testes assessed as inactive macroscopically showed advanced reproductive stage on histologic examination. Although a single biopsy caused no permanent damage to the testes and did not impact the general health status of the examined birds, repeated endoscopic examination resulted in testicular cicatrization or adhesions with the air sacs. In addition, some birds had delayed recovery after endoscopy. A biopsy of 1 testis done once or even repeatedly during a 1-year period had no impact on sperm production or quality.<p>

The effects of GH substitution on skeletal mass, bone turnover, and calcium metabolism were investigated in 29 patients with GH deficiency who were randomized to sc injections with GH (2 IU/m2 day) or placebo for 12 months. During GH treatment, serum insulin-like growth factor I increased 263 +/- 98% (P &lt; 0.001). Serum osteocalcin, bone a alkaline phosphatase, and procollagen type I C-terminal propeptide increased by 376 +/- 78% (P &lt; 0.005), 128 +/- 17% (P &lt; 0.005), and 100 +/- 17% (P &lt; 0.005), respectively. Serum type I collagen telopeptide and urinary levels of pyridinoline, deoxypyridinoline, and hydroxyproline rose by 158 +/- 39% (P &lt; 0.005), 170 +/- 48% (P &lt; 0.005), 156 +/- 78% (P &lt; 0.005), and 161 +/- 50% (P &lt; 0.005), respectively. Serum ionized calcium rose by 1.7 +/- 0.6% (P &lt; 0.05), whereas serum PTH decreased insignificantly. Vitamin D metabolites remained unaltered. Urinary calcium/creatinine increased and phosphate/creatinine decreased transiently, returning to baseline values at 9 months. When measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, whole body bone mineral density (BMD) and (BMD) of the radius decreased 2.4 +/- 0.6% (P &lt; 0.05) and 3.5 +/- 1.0% (P &lt; 0.005), respectively, whereas no significant changes were observed in BMD of the femur or spine. Our results indicate that long term GH treatment activates bone remodeling in patients with GH deficiency. The observed slight decrease in BMD may be explained by expansion of the remodeling space and reduced mean age of bone tissue. IT remains unclear whether long term treatment with GH will lead to an increase in bone mass and improved skeletal biomechanical competence.<p>

Three-dimensional dose calculation techniques developed for radiotherapy treatment planning were used to calculate dose distributions from unidirectional, planar rotational and omnidirectional incident radiation (experimental proton beams and solar flares). The calculations predicted regions of high dose within primate heads exposed to 55-MeV protons, supporting the postulate of radiation-induced brain tumors within this population. Comparisons among predicted doses to the human head from solar flares of three different energies demonstrated differences between unidirectional and omnidirectional irradiation in the space environment. The results can be used to estimate dose distributions based on a) limited phantom measurements, or b) nonuniformly incident radiation in orbit; both situations are difficult to replicate under laboratory exposure conditions.<p>

Harrison, L. B., et al. (1994). &quot;Performance status after treatment for squamous cell cancer of the base of tongue--a comparison of primary radiation therapy versus primary surgery.&quot; <u>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys</u> <b>30</b>(4): 953-957.<p>
PURPOSE: To compare the quality of life and functional outcome in patients with squamous cell cancer of the base of tongue treated with primary radiation vs. primary surgery. METHODS AND MATERIALS: At our institution, patients with base of tongue cancer are primarily treated either by radiation or surgery depending upon the philosophy of their primary physician. Primary radiation consists of 45-54 Gy external beam radiation followed by an 192Ir implant delivering an additional 20-30 Gy over 2-3 days. A neck dissection is done at the same time as the implant for those with involved nodes. Primary surgery consists of resection of the base of tongue lesion, neck dissection and postoperative radiation therapy. Because both groups have similar local control in our experience (80-90%), we used a subjective performance status scale for head and neck cancer patients to assess the quality of life in these patients (0-100, 0 = worst function, 100 = normal function). This scale measures ability to eat in public, understandability of speech, and normalcy of diet. There were 30 radiation patients (21: T1-T2; nine: T3-T4) and ten surgery patients (five: T1-T2; five: T3-T4) available for long-term quality of life assessment. RESULTS: Patients treated with radiation had consistently better performance status scores and quality of life according to our study. This was true for those with early (T1-2) as well as more advanced (T3-4) disease. For eating in public, T1-2 patients had scores of 85 vs. 75 (p = .31) and T3-4 patients had scores of 82 vs. 35 (p &lt; .0001) for radiation vs. surgery, respectively. For understandability of speech, T1-2 patients had scores of 92 vs. 65 (p = .0021), and T3-4 patients had scores of 95 vs. 35 (p &lt; .0001) for radiation vs. surgery, respectively. For normalcy of diet, T1-2 patients had scores of 74 vs. 50 (p = .047), and T3-4 patients had scores of 78 vs. 32 (p = .0012) for radiation vs. surgery, respectively. In addition, we compared scores for early vs. advanced disease treated by the same modality. For radiation, there was no difference in all three functional categories for T1-2 vs. T3-4 (p = .84), showing that quality of life scores remain high for all stages. For surgery, functional status deteriorated significantly when comparing T1-2 vs. T3-4 (p = .0014), consistent with the fact that larger tumors require more extensive operations. CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy provides a better performance status than surgery for base of tongue cancer. This is true for both early and advanced disease. Because radiation also provides similar local control and survival, our data suggests that radiation may be the preferred strategy. Functional scores remain high for all T stages treated with radiation, but deteriorate with more advanced T stages for patients treated with surgery. Similar studies using objective criteria are needed to further compare these treatments.<p>

The respiratory protein of the tarantula Eurypelma californicum is a 4 x 6-meric hemocyanin that binds oxygen with high cooperativity. This requires the existence of different conformations which have been confirmed by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Here we present reconstructed 3D-models of the oxy- and deoxy-forms of tarantula hemocyanins, as obtained by fitting small angle X-rays scattering curves on the basis of known X-ray structures and electron microscopy of related hemocyanins. For the first time, the involvement of movements at all levels of the quaternary structure was confirmed for an arthropod hemocyanin upon oxygenation. The two identical 2 x 6-meric half-molecules of the native 4 x 6-mer were shifted in the oxy-state along each other compared with the deoxy-state by about 14 A. In addition, the angle between the two 2 x 6-meric half-molecules increased by 13 degrees. Within these 2 x 6-mers the two hexamers were rotated against each other by about 26 degrees with respect to the deoxy-state. In addition, the distance between the two trimers of each hexamer increased upon oxygenation by about 2.5 A. These strongly coupled movements are based on the particular hierarchical structure of the 4 x 6-mer. It also shows a concept of allosteric interaction in hierarchically assembled proteins to guarantee the involvement of all subunits of a native oligomer to establish very high Hill coefficients.<p>

Incidence of prostate cancer has increased steadily in Norway since the cancer registration started in the 1950s. In Oslo, however, the figures show decreasing incidence since the 1970s, a trend not observed in any other region. These changes have occurred in the groups older than 70 years of age. The most important change is a marked decrease in the number of cases first diagnosed at autopsy, from 12.7% in 1957-61 to 3.8% in 1987-91. However, even after these cases are excluded, a slight downward trend in incidence still exists. The same tendencies are not observed for other forms of cancer. It seems as if the diagnostic intensity has become lower in Oslo than in the rest of the country. This pattern may be explained by a change of priority in diagnostics, owing to scarce resources, but other reasons, such as stabilization of the incidence of prostatic cancer, are also possible.<p>

Prenatal lung development requires fetal breathing movements (FBM). To investigate the dependence of FBM on feedback originating from the lung, we hypothesized that pneumonectomy stimulates FBM. Time-dated fetal sheep underwent bilateral pneumonectomy, unilateral pneumonectomy, or sham surgery at 125-130 days gestation. The incidence of FBM decreased in sham-operated fetuses at 142 days versus 130 days (p = 0.013), but was unchanged across all gestational ages in bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses (p &gt; or = 0.52). In unilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses, the incidence of FBM remained unchanged until 139 days and was higher than that of the bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses at 130-136 days gestation (p &lt; or = 0.03). The amplitude of integrated diaphragmatic electromyographic activity (integralEMG(di)) and total respiratory output (frequency of breathing x integralEMG(di)) were lower in pneumonectomized fetuses versus sham-operated fetuses at later gestational ages (p &lt; 0.05). These decreases in integralEMG(di) and total respiratory output were most pronounced at 142 days in bilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses versus sham-operated fetuses (p = 0.006 and 0.016, respectively). Low-voltage electrocortical activity (ECoG) increased, and high-voltage ECoG decreased, in unilaterally pneumonectomized fetuses compared with sham-operated fetuses (p = 0.04). In conclusion, we provide new evidence that feedback from the fetal lung modulates the incidence and various components of phrenic nerve output, suggesting a positive feedback mechanism between FBM and lung development.<p>

The static x-ray imager (SXI) is a diagnostic used at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to measure the position of the x rays produced by lasers hitting a gold foil target. The intensity distribution taken by the SXI camera during a NIF shot is used to determine how accurately NIF can aim laser beams. This is critical to proper NIF operation. Imagers are located at the top and the bottom of the NIF target chamber. The charge coupled device (CCD) chip is an x-ray sensitive silicon sensor, with a large format array (2k x 2k), 24 microm square pixels, and 15 microm thick. A multianode Manson x-ray source, operating up to 10 kV and 10 W, was used to characterize and calibrate the imagers. The output beam is heavily filtered to narrow the spectral beam width, giving a typical resolution E/DeltaE approximately = 10. The x-ray beam intensity was measured using an x-ray photodiode that has an accuracy better than 1% up to the Si K edge and better than 5% at higher energies. The x-ray beam provides full CCD illumination and is flat, within +/-1% maximum to minimum. The spectral efficiency was measured at ten energy bands ranging from 930 to 8470 eV. We observed an energy dependent pixel sensitivity variation that showed continuous change over a large portion of the CCD. The maximum sensitivity variation occurred at 8470 eV. The geometric pattern did not change at lower energies, but the maximum contrast decreased and was not observable below 4 keV. We were also able to observe debris, damage, and surface defects on the CCD chip. The Manson source is a powerful tool for characterizing the imaging errors of an x-ray CCD imager. These errors are quite different from those found in a visible CCD imager.<p>

A novel time, space, and energy-resolved x-ray spectrometer has been developed which produces, in a single snapshot, a broadband and relatively calibrated spectrum of the x-ray emission from a high-energy density laboratory plasma. The opacity zipper spectrometer (OZSPEC-1) records a nearly continuous spectrum for x-ray energies from 240 to 5800 eV in a single shot. The second-generation OZSPEC-2, detailed in this work, records fully continuous spectra on a single shot from any two of these three bands: 270-650, 660-1580, and 1960-4720 eV. These instruments thus record thermal and line radiation from a wide range of plasmas. These instruments' single-shot bandwidth is unmatched in a time-gated spectrometer; conversely, other broadband instruments are either time-integrated (using crystals or gratings), lack spectral resolution (diode arrays), or cover a lower energy band (gratings). The OZSPECs are based on the zipper detector, a large-format (100x35 mm) gated microchannel plate detector, with spectra dispersed along the 100 mm dimension. OZSPEC-1 and -2 both use elliptically bent crystals of OHM, RAP, and/or PET. Individual spectra are gated in 100 ps. OZSPEC-2 provides one-dimensional spatial imaging with 30-50 microm resolution over a 1500 microm field of view at the source. The elliptical crystal design yields broad spectral coverage with resolution E/DeltaE&gt;500, strong rejection of hard x-ray backgrounds, and negligible source broadening for extended sources. Near-term applications include plasma opacity measurements, detailed spectra of inertial fusion Hohlraums, and laboratory astrophysics experiments.<p>

The correct annotation of genes encoding the smallest proteins is one of the biggest challenges of genome annotation, and perhaps more importantly, few annotated short open reading frames have been confirmed to correspond to synthesized proteins. We used sequence conservation and ribosome binding site models to predict genes encoding small proteins, defined as having 16-50 amino acids, in the intergenic regions of the Escherichia coli genome. We tested expression of these predicted as well as previously annotated genes by integrating the sequential peptide affinity tag directly upstream of the stop codon on the chromosome and assaying for synthesis using immunoblot assays. This approach confirmed that 20 previously annotated and 18 newly discovered proteins of 16-50 amino acids are synthesized. We summarize the properties of these small proteins; remarkably more than half of the proteins are predicted to be single-transmembrane proteins, nine of which we show co-fractionate with cell membranes.<p>

PKH-26 was used as a viable fluorescent membrane stain for murine hematopoietic stem cells. The presence of the dye on the cells was shown not to interfere with their ability to form day-8 and -12 spleen colonies in lethally irradiated mice. To study their in vivo homing behavior in detail, 10(4) labeled cells from a population enriched for CFU-S were injected intravenously into nonirradiated mice and into mice irradiated 3 hours previously. At 17, 41, and 65 hours after injection, the numbers of labeled cells per organ were quantified using the specialty developed flow cytometric fluorescence hypercompensation procedure for the detection of rare events, which allows a detection sensitivity of 1 per 10(6). Spleen homing in irradiated and nonirradiated mice was virtually identical, whereas homing to nonirradiated bone marrow was 2.5 times higher than to irradiated bone marrow. This indicates a different homing mechanism for spleen and bone marrow. The results of this direct homing assay were placed in perspective with results of indirect homing studies from the literature, introducing a new &quot;h-factor.&quot; From the CFU-S data, putative specific enrichment factors for spleen-specific and bone marrow-specific homing were derived. Examination of the fluorescence intensity distribution among the labeled cell population indicated that virtually all cells started to proliferate rapidly after injection into both irradiated and nonirradiated animals. This indicates that specific signals from stromal elements in the stem cell niches are needed to keep the cells quiescent and that the majority of the transplanted stem cells do not home to such niches. The potential use of PKH-26 for in vivo characterization of stem cell niches is discussed.<p>

Femora and tibiae of rats carrying leukemia from a LacZ-marked acute promyelocytic leukemia-derived leukemic cell line (LT12NL15) were decalcified using EDTA and routinely embedded in paraffin. Sections were used to develop for the first time an immunostaining method for LacZ, employing catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) based on the deposition of biotinylated tyramine. This method was used to study homing and adhesion of leukemic cells.<p>

Energy partitioning, composition of lipids and fatty acids, and their utilization by embryos were determined in the lecithotrophic shrimp Macrobrachium borellii during seven development stages. The biochemical composition at stage I is represented by lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates, with 29.3, 28.7, and 0.2% dry weight, respectively. The former two were identified as the major energy-providing components, contributing 131 and 60 cal/100 mg egg, dry weight, respectively. The overall conversion efficiency (CE) was 45.0% (calculated as percentage of vitelline energy transformed into embryonic tissues). Lipids were the most important energy reserve (CE 39.3%), followed by proteins (CE 57.1%), both being simultaneously utilized during development while carbohydrates were synthesized de novo (CE 587.5%). Variation in the lipid class composition of embryos and vitellus showed an accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAG) and phospholipids (PL) up to stage IV, a more active accumulation and selective utilization phase (stages V and VI), and a consumption and de novo synthesis period until hatching. Structural lipids (PL and cholesterol) and pigment astaxanthin were selectively conserved in embryos, but TAG, hydrocarbons, and esterified sterols were preferentially depleted. Monounsaturated fatty acids (FA) were the major group in TAG, whereas polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were the major group in PL after organogenesis. Certain PUFA such as 22:6n-3 and 20:5n-3 were selectively accumulated in PL.<p>

In some animal models of autoimmune diseases the roles of exogenous and endogenous retroviruses are clearly defined. In ungulates caprine arthritis encephalitis virus, equine infectious anemia virus or Maedi-Visna virus infections cause a well-defined autoimmune disease and the appearance of seropositivity of the animals is of diagnostic value. Likewise, in MRL lpr/lpr mice insertion of a retrotransposon into the fas gene could clearly be shown to cause survival of autoreactive lymphocytes. Despite intensive research in this field over a long period of time, molecular data on retroviral involvement in either etiology or pathology of human SLE and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases remain rather scarce. However, the analysis of retroviral antibodies and antigens in human autoimmune disease is undoubtedly important with regard to the search for retroviruses as disease-causing agents.<p>

IL-2 deprivation induces apoptosis in human IL-2-dependent T-cell clones. This process is characterized by typical cell morphology, changes in the cellular membranes and fragmentation of chromatin into units of single and multiple nucleosomes. We isolated apoptotic DNA of an IL-2-deprived T-cell clone and sequenced randomly selected fragments representing single and multiple nucleosomes.The frequency of phased adenosine tracts was markedly increased in the small apoptotic fragments as compared to oligonucleosomes. Our results thus indicate that chromatin fragmentation in human apoptotic T-cells is not random but preferentially involves DNA sequences with the capability to form bent DNA. Whether this indicates a colocalization of DNase cleavage sites and phased adenosine tracts on the chromosomes or a bias in selecting sites for apoptotic DNA fragmentation is discussed. Analysing the underlying mechanisms will shed new light on DNA degradation in apoptosis.<p>

Analysis of somatic mutations revealed that induction of anti-dsDNA autoantibodies from SLE patients are antigen driven and thus T cell dependent. Since DNA per se has repeatedly been shown not to be immunogenic, various mechanisms leading to the production of anti-dsDNA-antibodies have been discussed including the role of oligonucleosomes. In the present study we demonstrate that the percentage of macrophage engulfing apoptotic cell material was significantly reduced in SLE as compared to control patients. These data suggest that, in contrast to a non-inflammatory clearance of apoptotic cell, phagocytosis of apoptotic cell material may be decreased in SLE patients, possibly leading to a presentation of autoantigens and thus possibly triggering an autoantibody response to nucleoproteins.<p>

Aestivation and dispersive migration are the two strategies evoked in the literature to explain the way in which malaria vectors Anopheles coluzzii and A. gambiae survive the harsh climatic conditions of the dry season in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the physiological mechanisms regulating these two strategies are unknown. In the present study, mosquito species were exposed to controlled environmental conditions mimicking the rainy and dry seasons of south western Burkina Faso. Survival strategies were studied through morphometric (wing length), ecophysiological (respiratory gas exchanges), biochemical (cuticular hydrocarbons composition) and molecular (AKH mRNA expression levels) parameters, variations of which are usually considered to be hallmarks of aestivation and dispersion mechanisms in various insects. Our results showed that ecophysiological and morphometric adjustments are made in both species to prevent water losses during the dry season. However, the usual metabolic rate modifications expected as signatures of aestivation and migration were not observed, highlighting specific and original physiological mechanisms sustaining survival in malaria mosquitoes during the dry season. Differences in epicuticular hydrocarbon composition and AKH levels of expression were found between the permanent and temporary A. coluzzii populations, illustrating the great phenotypic plasticity of this mosquito species. Altogether, our work underlines the diverse and complex pattern of changes occurring in the two mosquito species and at the population level to cope with the dry season and highlights potential targets of future control tools.<p>

Spiders belong to the chelicerates, which is an arthropod group that branches basally from myriapods, crustaceans and insects. Spiders are thus useful models with which to investigate whether aspects of development are ancestral or derived with respect to the arthropod common ancestor. Moreover, they serve as an important reference point for comparison with the development of other metazoans. Therefore, studies of spider development have made a major contribution to advancing our understanding of the evolution of development. Much of this knowledge has come from studies of the common house spider, Parasteatoda tepidariorum. Here, we describe how the growing number of experimental tools and resources available to study Parasteatoda development have provided novel insights into the evolution of developmental regulation and have furthered our understanding of metazoan body plan evolution.<p>

Numerous studies have reported that women believe they are more susceptible to left-right confusion than men. Indeed, some studies have also found sex differences in behavioural tasks. It has been suggested that women have more difficulties with left-right discrimination, because they are less lateralised than men and a lower degree of lateralisation might lead to more left-right confusion (LRC). However, those studies reporting more left-right confusion for women have been criticised because the tasks that have been used involved mental rotation, a spatial ability in which men typically excel. In the present study, 34 right-handed women and 31 right-handed men completed two behavioural left-right discrimination tasks, in which mental rotation was either experimentally controlled for or was not needed. To measure the degree of hemispheric asymmetry participants also completed a dichotic listening test. Although women were not less lateralised than men, both tasks consistently revealed that women were more susceptible to left-right confusion than men. However, only women with a significant right ear advantage in the dichotic listening test had more difficulties in LRC tasks than men. There was no sex difference in less lateralised participants. This finding suggests that the impact of functional verbal asymmetries on LRC is mediated by sex.<p>

Twenty-eight children with developmental disorders underwent an interdisciplinary assessment for diagnosis and recommendations about management. Following this assessment, the degree of agreement on diagnosis and recommendations between parents and the team was determined. There was substantial agreement for diagnosis of clearly identifiable conditions such as genetic disorders, autism, and mental retardation but less agreement for milder disorders such as learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, and emotional disorders. Agreement on management varied, being higher for speech therapy and psychosocial interventions but lower for use of stimulant medication and diet. The parents identified additional diagnostic labels in their child and mentioned more recommendations than the clinicians prescribed. The results suggest the need for careful attention to parent perceptions following interdisciplinary assessment.<p>

ATP synthase, a double-motor enzyme, plays various roles in the cell, participating not only in ATP synthesis but in ATP hydrolysis-dependent processes and in the regulation of a proton gradient across some membrane-dependent systems. Recent studies of ATP synthase as a potential molecular target for the treatment of some human diseases have displayed promising results, and this enzyme is now emerging as an attractive molecular target for the development of new therapies for a variety of diseases. Significantly, ATP synthase, because of its complex structure, is inhibited by a number of different inhibitors and provides diverse possibilities in the development of new ATP synthase-directed agents. In this review, we classify over 250 natural and synthetic inhibitors of ATP synthase reported to date and present their inhibitory sites and their known or proposed modes of action. The rich source of ATP synthase inhibitors and their known or purported sites of action presented in this review should provide valuable insights into their applications as potential scaffolds for new therapeutics for human and animal diseases as well as for the discovery of new pesticides and herbicides to help protect the world's food supply. Finally, as ATP synthase is now known to consist of two unique nanomotors involved in making ATP from ADP and P(i), the information provided in this review may greatly assist those investigators entering the emerging field of nanotechnology.<p>

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of supervised exercise training on cardiopulmonary function and fatigue in cancer survivors undergoing various clinical treatments. DESIGN: Pretest and post-test quasiexperimental. SETTING: Outpatient oncology rehabilitation center. SAMPLE: 96 breast cancer survivors undergoing various clinical treatments. METHODS: Subjects were divided into four groups based on the specific type of clinical treatment: surgery alone (n = 22); surgery and chemotherapy (n = 30); surgery and radiation (n = 17); and surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation (n = 27). Following a comprehensive screening and medical examination, cardiovascular endurance, pulmonary function, and fatigue were assessed, leading to the development of an individualized exercise prescription and a six-month exercise intervention. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and covariance were used to compare the effectiveness of the intervention and differences among treatment groups. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, predicted oxygen consumption, time on treadmill, and fatigue. FINDINGS: Cardiopulmonary function (predicted maximal oxygen consumption and time on treadmill) significantly increased in all groups after exercise training. In addition, resting heart rate and forced vital capacity significantly improved in those receiving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Psychologically, the exercise intervention resulted in significant reductions in behavioral, affective, sensory, cognitive and mood, and total fatigue scale scores in all three groups who received treatment with surgery. The breast cancer survivors in the surgery-alone group showed significant reductions in behavioral, affective, and total fatigue scale scores but not in sensory and cognitive and mood fatigue scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that moderate intensity, individualized, prescriptive exercise maintains or improves cardiopulmonary function with concomitant reductions in fatigue regardless of treatment type. Moreover, cancer survivors receiving combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy following surgery appear to benefit to a greater extent as a result of an individualized exercise intervention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Clinicians need to be aware of adjuvant therapies such as moderate exercise that attenuate negative side effects of cancer treatments. Symptom management recommendations should be given to cancer survivors concerning the effectiveness of exercise throughout the cancer continuum and the importance of participating in a cancer rehabilitation exercise program.<p>

A de novo designed beta-hairpin peptide (MAX8), capable of undergoing intramolecular folding and consequent intermolecular self-assembly into a cytocompatible hydrogel, has been studied. A combination of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) have been used to quantitatively investigate the MAX8 nanofibrillar hydrogel network morphology. A change in the peptide concentration from 0.5 to 2 wt% resulted in a denser fibrillar network as revealed via SANS by a change in the high q (q = (4 pi/lambda) x sin (theta/2), where lambda = wavelength of incident neutrons and theta = scattering angle) mass fractal exponent from 2.5 to 3 and by a decrease in the measured correlation length from 23 to 16 A. A slope of -4 in the USANS regime indicates well-defined gel microporosity, an important characteristic for cellular substrate applications. These changes, both at the network as well as the individual fibril lengthscales, can be directly visualized in situ by cryo-TEM. Fibrillar nanostructures and network properties are directly related to bulk hydrogel stiffness via oscillatory rheology. Preliminary cell viability and anchorage studies at varying hydrogel stiffness confirm cell adhesion at early stages of cell culture within the window of stiffness investigated. Knowledge of the precise structure spanning length scales from the nanoscale up to the microscale can help in the formation of future, specific structure-bioproperty relationships when studying in vitro and in vivo behavior of these new peptide scaffolds.<p>

Erwinia herbicola is a nonphotosynthetic bacterium that is yellow pigmented due to the presence of carotenoids. When the Erwinia carotenoid biosynthetic genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, this bacterium also displays a yellow phenotype. The DNA sequence of the plasmid pPL376, carrying the entire Erwinia carotenoid gene cluster, has been found to contain 12 open reading frames (ORFs). Six of the ORFs have been identified as carotenoid biosynthesis genes that code for all the enzymes required for conversion of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) to zeaxanthin diglucoside via geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, phytoene, lycopene, beta-carotene, and zeaxanthin. These enzymatic steps were assigned after disruption of each ORF by a specific mutation and analysis of the accumulated intermediates. Carotenoid intermediates were identified by the absorption spectra of the colored components and by high pressure liquid chromatographic analysis. The six carotenoid genes are arranged in at least two operons. The gene coding for beta-carotene hydroxylase is transcribed in the opposite direction from that of the other carotenoid genes and overlaps with the gene for phytoene synthase.<p>

Inherited mtDNA mutations cause severe human disease. In most species, mitochondria are inherited maternally through mechanisms that are poorly understood. Genes that specifically control the inheritance of mitochondria in the germline are unknown. Here, we show that the long isoform of the protein Oskar regulates the maternal inheritance of mitochondria in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that, during oogenesis, mitochondria accumulate at the oocyte posterior, concurrent with the bulk streaming and churning of the oocyte cytoplasm. Long Oskar traps and maintains mitochondria at the posterior at the site of primordial germ cell (PGC) formation through an actin-dependent mechanism. Mutating long oskar strongly reduces the number of mtDNA molecules inherited by PGCs. Therefore, Long Oskar ensures germline transmission of mitochondria to the next generation. These results provide molecular insight into how mitochondria are passed from mother to offspring, as well as how they are positioned and asymmetrically partitioned within polarized cells.<p>

A common treatment option for many breast and prostate cancer patients is the use of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist such as goserelin acetate (GA) which reduces sex hormone levels. This treatment, however, is associated with bone degeneration, and exercise has been suggested as a means of preventing this side effect. Little is known about the effects of low intensity, low volume exercise on GA-induced bone loss. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to investigate the effects of voluntary wheel running on bone architecture in growing male (M) and female (F) rats receiving GA treatment. Rats received an 8-week GA treatment or placebo (CON) and were either housed in cages equipped with voluntary running wheels (WR) or remained sedentary (SED) in standard cages throughout the experimental period. Following treatments, tibiae were excised and analyzed for cortical bone (cross-sectional volume, cortical volume, marrow volume, cortical thickness) and cancellous bone (bone volume/total volume, trabecular number, trabecular thickness, trabecular spacing) using micro-computed tomography. Treatment with GA resulted in a significant reduction in running wheel distances in both sexes throughout the study period (P&lt;0.05). GA treatment had no effect on cortical bone architecture in neither sex (P&gt;0.05). Cancellous bone degeneration, however, was observed in M and F SED+GA (P&lt;0.05). No significant differences were observed in M WR+GA animals in bone volume/total volume, trabecular number and trabecular spacing when compared to M SED+CON (P&gt;0.05). In F WR+GA, trabecular thickness did not differ from that of F SED+CON (P&gt;0.05), and trabecular spacing was found to be significantly lower than F SED+GA (P&lt;0.05). The current report indicates that 8 weeks of GA treatment promotes cancellous bone degeneration, and voluntary wheel running provides no clear osteoprotection in growing male and female rats.<p>

Dietary sterols including cholesterol and phytosterols are essential substrates for insect steroid hormone (ecdysteroid) synthesis in the prothoracic glands (PGs). In the silkworm Bombyx mori, one of the model species of insects, the steroidogenesis has been well demonstrated that cholesterol biotransformation into ecdysone in the PG cells. Because insects lack the ability to synthesize cellular sterol de novo, lipoprotein, lipophorin (Lp), has been thought to be the major cholesterol supply source; however, details of cholesterol behavior from Lp to the PG cells has not been analyzed till date. In this report, we developed Lp incorporation method using labeled cholesterols such as 22-NBD-cholesterol and cholesterol-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-d7 (cholesterol-d7), and analyzed the internalization and metabolism of cholesterol in PGs in vitro using the silkworm Bombyx mori. The internalization of cholesterol was visualized using 22-NBD-cholesterol. PGs showed an enriched cellular 22-NBD-cholesterol signal, which dissociated from the Lp localizing at the close area of cell membrane. The distribution pattern observed in the PGs was different from other tissues such as the brain, fat body, and Malpighian tubules, suggesting that the internalization of cholesterol in the PGs was distinct from other tissues. The metabolism of cholesterol was traced using LC-MS/MS methods to detect cholesterol-d7, 7-dehydrocholesterol-d7 (an expected intermediate metabolite), and the final product ecdysone-d6. 7-Dehydrocholesterol-d7 and ecdysone-d6 were detected in the PG culture incubated with labeled Lp, showing that the cholesterol of Lp was utilized for ecdysone synthesis in the PGs. Our results reveal the distinct behavior of cholesterol in the PGs, with the first direct evidence of biochemical fate of lipoprotein cholesterol in insect steroidogenic organ. This will aid in the understanding of the involvement of lipoprotein cholesterol in steroid hormone synthesis in insects.<p>

Silicon carbide is produced by a chemical reaction at high temperature between free crystalline silica and petroleum coke. The process generates airborne fibers and fibrogenic dusts such as alpha-quartz and cristobalite, which are also potentially carcinogenic. The authors report that this is the first cohort study in this industry. The study was carried out among 585 Quebec silicon carbide production workers who had worked at any time from 1950 to 1980. Follow-up was to December 31, 1989, and 167 deaths were observed. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for all causes of death was 1.05 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90-1.23); for nonmalignant respiratory diseases it was 2.03 (95% CI 1.21-3.22); and for lung cancer it was 1.69 (95% CI 1.09-2.52). Controlling for smoking status using a Cox regression analysis, the risk for nonmalignant respiratory diseases and for lung cancer increased with exposure to total dust; in the highest exposure category, rate ratios (RR) were 4.08 (95% CI 1.11-14.96) for nonmalignant respiratory diseases and 1.67 (95% CI 0.57-4.83) for lung cancer. Results were in the expected direction, but the power of the study was low, because of small sample size and use of cumulative total dust as the exposure variable, which may be a poor indicator of lung irritants and other potential carcinogens in this industry, notably silicon carbide ceramic fibers.<p>

The ovary and the fat body of Drosophila melanogaster both synthesise vitellogenins in vivo. The ovary contributes nearly as much vitellogenin to the yolk of an oocyte as does the fat body. Densitometry of fluorographs and gels has been used to compare the amount of the smallest vitellogenin polypeptide, yolk protein 3, synthesised by each tissue. Cell-free translations indicate that the ovary, in contrast to the fat body, contains a much reduced level of the mRNA for yolk protein 3 compared with the mRNAs for the other vitellogenin polypeptides. However, if tissues are cultured in vitro, the underproduction of this protein by the ovary is not significant. Because young embryos have levels of this polypeptide which are expected if the ovary has a low level of its corresponding mRNA, we argue that the ovary genuinely underproduces this protein in vivo and that the relative levels synthesised by the ovary in vitro are an artefact. Egg chambers of previtellogenic stages can synthesise vitellogenins, but the maximum level of vitellogenin synthesis occurs in egg chambers of the early vitellogenic stages. We conclude that the expression of the vitellogenin genes is subject to different controls at each site of synthesis. The possible cell types responsible for ovarian vitellogenin synthesis are discussed; the follicle epithelial cells are tentatively nominated for this role. We also suggest that a specific repression mechanism for vitellogenin gene expression exists in the ovary.<p>

This short review describes the molecular evolution and phylogeny of various defense molecules participating in the host defense of horseshoe crab. It is well known that invertebrate animals, which lack adaptive immune systems, have developed various defense systems, so called innate immunity, that respond to common antigens on the surface of potential pathogens. The systems include hemolymph coagulation, melanization, cell agglutination, antimicrobial action, active oxygen formation, and phagocytic action. Among them, hemolymph coagulation and phenoloxidase-mediated melanization, in addition to cell agglutination, are directly induced by foreign substances, that result in the engulfment of invading microbes. The immobilized invaders are finally killed by antimicrobial substances released mainly from many kinds of hemocytes. In the past two decades, we have investigated biochemically various defense molecules, using horseshoe crab as a model animal, and established extensively their molecular structures. These results now make it possible to discuss evolution and phylogeny of the defense molecules at a molecular level, in comparison with those derived from vertebrate animals. Here, the authors will describe the present state of our knowledge concerning molecules mainly associated with innate immunity.<p>

The function of the open reading frame 2 product (p2) of cacao swollen shoot virus (CSSV) and of other badnaviruses is not yet determined. Their carboxyl-termini are lysine and proline rich and also contain alanine residues, amino acids present at the C-termini of histone-like proteins. Full-length CSSV p2 (132 amino acids) or versions truncated at the C-terminus (128, 113, 103, or 101 amino acids) were expressed in Escherichia coli and partially purified. When assayed in nucleic acid-binding tests, p2 was able to interact with CSSV and other double-stranded DNAs and with CSSV and other single-stranded RNA transcripts in sequence-nonspecific manner. Moreover, this binding activity was progressively lost as the C-terminus was gradually deleted.<p>

Fluorescence quenching studies and binding experiments with [(3)H]ecdysone reveal that the respiratory protein, hemocyanin, of the tarantula Eurypelma californicum binds ecdysone. The binding constant for ecdysone ranges between 0.5 and 5 mM, indicating a low affinity binding. However, it is comparable with those found for the ecdysone binding to hexamerins from insects. Based on a comparison of sequences and x-ray structures of arthropodan hemocyanins, we propose an evolutionary conserved hydrophobic pocket in domain 1 of the hemocyanin subunit that may bind ecdysone.<p>

The degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by Moraxella and Pseudomonas spp. involves an initial monooxygenase-catalyzed removal of the nitro group. The resultant hydroquinone is subject to ring fission catalyzed by a dioxygenase enzyme. We have isolated a strain of an Arthrobacter sp., JS443, capable of degrading PNP with stoichiometric release of nitrite. During induction of the enzymes required for growth on PNP, 1,2,4-benzenetriol was identified as an intermediate by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and radiotracer studies. 1,2,4-Benzenetriol was converted to maleylacetic acid, which was further degraded by the beta-ketoadipate pathway. Conversion of PNP to 1,2,4-benzenetriol is catalyzed by a monooxygenase system in strain JS443 through the formation of 4-nitrocatechol, 4-nitroresorcinol, or both. Our results clearly indicate the existence of an alternative pathway for the biodegradation of PNP.<p>

Vitellin from the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, was purified from eggs using gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The purified protein had a native molecular mass of 480 kDa. Under reducing conditions (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SDS-PAGE), vitellin was composed of seven polypeptides each at 154, 135, 87, 78, 67, 64 and 35 kDa. The isoelectric point was pH 6.9 and absorption maxima for the yolk protein were 280 and 400 nm. As in other ticks, vitellin from I. scapularis is also a hemoglycolipoprotein. Carbohydrates detected in vitellin were predominantly mannose with a small amount of N-acetylglucosamine. Lipids detected by thin layer chromatography (TLC) were triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids associated with vitellin were phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine. Polyclonal serum produced in rabbits recognized vitellin from the eggs and ovaries, and vitellogenin from the hemolymph and fat body in reproductive females. This is the first report on the characterization of yolk proteins from a prostriate tick.<p>

There are concerns as to whether South Africa's public health system has sufficient resources, human and otherwise, to ensure universal access to antiretroviral treatment (ART). We report on public sector implementation of the Comprehensive Care Management and Treatment (CCMT) programme in the Free State Province, South Africa, in particular whether the primary health care (PHC) infrastructure was able to mobilise the necessary inputs to effectively provide ART, without undermining other services within facilities. A longitudinal study was conducted of the first 16 PHC facilities accredited to provide ART in the province. The facilities were visited on three occasions over 2 years, involving both structured and open-ended interviews with professional and lay staff, and observations of available resources. The resources assessed were staffing, space, essential equipment, drug supplies and laboratory systems. Approximately one-fifth (20%) of professional nurses were allocated to the CCMT programme in the facilities, although the overall number of professional nurses increased by only 14%. This process resulted in some displacement of professional nurses towards the CCMT Programme away from other services in the facilities. However, this could have been partially compensated for by task shifting towards community health workers and the appointment of additional support staff. Staff were largely positive about the programme. Drug supplies, availability of equipment and laboratory systems, although good at the baseline, improved further over the period of observation. The lack of adequate space to accommodate the new programme was a frequently reported problem. Overall, our assessment is that the PHC infrastructure in the Free State's public health system is capable of implementing and benefiting from the CCMT programme. Nevertheless, constraints in the availability of professional staff threaten future implementation of both the CCMT and other PHC programmes.<p>

Jansen, A., et al. (2008). &quot;Aetiology of community-acquired, acute gastroenteritis in hospitalised adults: a prospective cohort study.&quot; <u>BMC Infectious Diseases</u> <b>8</b>: 143.<p>
BACKGROUND: The aetiology of severe gastroenteritis leading to hospitalisation in adults frequently remains unclear. Our objective was to study the causes and characteristics of community-acquired, acute gastroenteritis in adult hospitalized patients to support the clinical management of these patients. METHODS: From August 2005 to August 2007, we conducted a prospective cohort study among patients &gt; or =18 y hospitalized with community-acquired gastroenteritis in a university hospital in Berlin, Germany. Stool specimens were examined for 26 gastrointestinal pathogens, supplemented by serologic tests for antibodies to Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., and Entamoeba histolytica. Patient data on demographics and clinical presentation were recorded and analyzed. Coexisting medical conditions were assessed using the Charlson Comorbidity Index score. RESULTS: Of 132 patients presenting with acute community-acquired gastroenteritis, 104 were included in the study. A non-infectious aetiology was diagnosed in 8 patients (8%). In 79 (82%) of the remaining 96 patients at least one microorganism was identified. Campylobacter spp. (35%) was detected most frequently, followed by norovirus (23%), Salmonella spp. (20%), and rotavirus (15%). In 46% of the patients with Campylobacter spp. infection, the diagnosis was made solely by serology. More than one pathogen was found in seventeen (22%) patients. Simultaneous infection was significantly more likely in patients with rotavirus and salmonella infections (RR 3.6; 95% CI: 1.8-7.4; RR 2.5; 95%CI: 1.2-5.5). Length of hospital stay (median: 5.5 days) was independent of the pathogen, but was associated with coexisting medical conditions (OR 4,8; 95%CI:2,0-11,6). CONCLUSION: Known enteric pathogens were detected in 82% of adult patients who were hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. We found that currently used culture-based methods may miss a substantial proportion of Campylobacter infections, and additional serological testing for Campylobacter should be considered. Viral infections emerged as an important cause of severe gastroenteritis in adults, and viral-bacterial co-infections in adults are probably underrecognized so far. The presence of coexisting medical conditions--but not the etiological agent--was a predictor for the duration of the hospital stay.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors predictive of relief of respiratory symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). DESIGN: A case series of patients with GERD and respiratory symptoms undergoing fundoplication from 1987 to 1994 at a tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Of 118 patients undergoing fundoplication for cardinal symptoms of GERD, 63 had respiratory symptoms. Postoperative follow-up information was available in 50 patients at a median of 3 years. INTERVENTIONS: The presence of GERD was documented on the basis of barium swallow, esophagoscopy, esophageal manometry, and 24-hour pH studies. A standardized questionnaire was used to score symptoms. A Nissen fundoplication was performed in 39 patients, a Collis-Belsey fundoplication in 3 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A repeat standardized questionnaire was used to evaluate the response to surgery for each symptom experienced. Univariate analysis was performed to evaluate factors influencing outcome. RESULTS: Respiratory symptoms were present in 53% (63/118) of patients with GERD. Fundoplication relieved the respiratory symptoms in 76% (38/50) of the patients. Reflux symptoms were relieved in 86% (43/50) of the patients. Abnormalities of esophageal motility were present in 34% (17/50) of the patients, and these were significantly more common in patients who did not experience relief of their respiratory symptoms (9/12 vs 8/38, chi 2 = 9.54, P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms are common in patients with GERD. Unlike classic reflux symptoms, the beneficial effects of antireflux surgery on respiratory symptoms are less predictable. The probability of relief of these respiratory symptoms with antireflux surgery is directly dependent on esophageal motor function.<p>

The annual reproductive cycle of the male snow leopard (Panthera uncia) was characterized by evaluating seminal and endocrine traits monthly. Testicular volume was greatest (P &lt; 0.05) during the winter months when the quality of ejaculate was optimal. Ejaculate volume, total sperm concentration ml-1, motile sperm concentration per ejaculate, sperm morphology and sperm motility index were lowest during the summer and autumn months compared with the winter and spring. Peripheral LH, FSH and testosterone concentrations were also lowest during the summer months, increasing during the autumn just before the increase in semen quality, and were maximal during the winter months. There was a direct relationship (P &lt; 0.01) between: (1) testosterone and testicular volume, total sperm concentration ml-1, motile sperm concentration per ejaculate and ejaculate volume, and (2) LH and testicular volume and motile sperm concentration per ejaculate. In summary, although spermatozoa were recovered throughout the year, optimal gamete quality was observed during the winter and spring. Although previous studies in felids have demonstrated seasonal effects on either seminal or endocrine traits, this is the first study to demonstrate a distinct effect of season on both pituitary and testicular function.<p>

We investigated the regulation of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor (MChR) in brain from seven species of fish, two surrogates and five threatened or endangered species exposed to a series of chemicals as a measure of compensatory response among species. Fish were classified as either cold water (rainbow trout-surrogate, apache trout, lahanton trout) or warm water (fathead minnow-surrogate, razorback sucker, bonytail chub, colorado squawfish) and were exposed to chemicals shown to affect cholinergic pathways (carbaryl and permethrin) and two chemicals whose relationships to the cholinergic system is less clear (4-nonylphenol and copper). Downregulation of MChR occurred in all warm water species, except colorado squawfish, and at carbaryl concentrations similar to those causing downregulation observed in rainbow trout. Permethrin exposure resulted in downregulation in fathead minnow and razorback sucker, but the concentrations required for observation of this phenomenon were much greater than observed in cold water species. Copper exposure caused a decrease in brain MChR in rainbow trout and apache trout, whereas 4-nonylphenol exposure resulted in a decrease in brain MChR in all three cold water species. Our results indicate that surrogates are useful in assessing sublethal physiological responses to chemicals with a known mechanism of action such as carbaryl and support use of surrogates for assessing physiological responses to chemicals with diverse, less clear mechanisms of action.<p>

BACKGROUND: Nonlinear electroencephalographic parameters, e.g., approximate entropy, have been suggested as measures of the hypnotic component of anesthesia. Compared with linear methods, they may detect additional information and quantify the irregularity of a dynamical system. High dimensionality of a signal and disturbances may affect these parameters and change their ability to distinguish consciousness from unconsciousness. Methods of order pattern analysis, in this investigation represented by permutation entropy, recurrence rate, and phase coupling of order recurrence plots, are suitable for any type of time series, whether deterministic or noisy. They may provide a better estimation of the hypnotic component of anesthesia than other nonlinear parameters. METHODS: The current analysis is based on electroencephalographic data from two similar clinical studies in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia with sevoflurane or propofol. The study period was from induction until patients followed command after surgery, including a reduction of the hypnotic agent after tracheal intubation until patients followed command. Prediction probability was calculated to assess the parameter's ability to separate consciousness from unconsciousness at the transition between both states. RESULTS: Parameters of order pattern analysis provide a prediction probability of maximal 0.85 (training study) and 0.78 (evaluation study) with frequencies from 0 to 30 Hz, and maximal 0.87 (training study) and 0.83 (evaluation study) including frequencies up to 70 Hz, both higher than 0.77 (approximate entropy). CONCLUSIONS: Parameters of the nonlinear method order pattern analysis separate consciousness from unconsciousness and are grossly independent of high-frequency components of the electroencephalogram.<p>

Jorgensen, J. O., et al. (1996). &quot;Influence of growth hormone and androgens on body composition in adults.&quot; <u>Hormone Research</u> <b>45</b>(1-2): 94-98.<p>
The secretion of both growth hormone (GH) and androgens declines with age which may play a role in the senescent changes in body composition and organ function. Among healthy adults abdominal adiposity is an important negative determinant of GH secretion. Surprisingly, abdominal or android obesity seems inversely correlated with testosterone levels in males but not in females. The ability of GH to promote lipolysis and preserve or increase lean body mass has been reappraised in substitution studies in GH-deficient adults. By comparison, adequately controlled studies of androgen replacement in hypogonadal and/or elderly males are few. In view of the physiological and clinical relevance of obtaining information about the aging process, there is a need for controlled experiments addressing similarities and differences between the action of GH and sex steroids in adults.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Studies with GH substitution in GH-deficient (GHD) adults lasting more than 6 months have so far been uncontrolled. End-points such as physical fitness and body composition may be subject to a considerable placebo effect which weakens the validity of open studies. We therefore tested GH (2 IU/m2 per day) versus placebo treatment for 12 months. DESIGN: Twenty-nine patients (mean age 45.5 +/- 2.0 years) with adult-onset GHD were studied in a double-blind, parallel design. Measurements of body composition by means of conventional anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance (BIA), CT scan and DEXA scan, exercise capacity, and isometric muscle strength were performed at baseline and after 12 months treatment. For body composition measurements a control group of 39 healthy, age and sex-matched subjects was included. RESULTS: Sum of skinfolds (SKF) at 4 sites decreased significantly after GH treatment. Total body fat (TBF) as assessed by DEXA and BIA was elevated at baseline but normalized after GH. TBF assessed by SKF revealed significantly higher levels compared to DEXA and BIA, although all estimates intercorrelated closely. Visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat decreased by 25 and 17%, respectively after GH (P &lt; 0.01) to levels no longer different from the control group. CT of the mid thigh revealed a significant reduction in fat tissue and a significant increase in muscle volume after GH treatment, both of which resulted in a normalization of the muscle: fat ratio (%) (placebo: 58:42 (baseline) vs 58:42 (12 months); GH: 66:34 (baseline) vs 72:28 (12 months) (P = 0.002); normal subjects: 67:33 (P &lt; 0.05 when compared to 12 months placebo data)). Total body resistance and resistance relative to muscle volume decreased significantly after GH treatment suggesting over-hydration as compared to normal subjects. Exercise capacity (kJ) increased significantly after GH treatment (placebo: 54.7 +/- 9.8 (baseline) vs 51.6 +/- 8.2 (12 months); GH: 64.9 +/- 13.3 (baseline) vs 73.5 +/- 13.6 (12 months) (P &lt; 0.05)). Isometric quadriceps strength increased after GH but no treatment effect could be detected owing to a small increase in the placebo group. Serum IGF-I levels (microgram/l) were low baseline and increased markedly after GH treatment to a level exceeding that of normal subjects (270 +/- 31 (12 months GH) vs 156 +/- 8 (normal subjects (P &lt; 0.01)). The levels of serum electrolytes and HbA1c remained unchanged. The number of adverse effects were higher in the GH group after 3 months, but not after 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The reduction in excess visceral fat during GH substitution is pronounced and sustained; (2) beneficial effects on total body fat, muscle volume and physical fitness can be reproduced during prolonged placebo-controlled conditions; (3) uncontrolled data on muscle strength must be interpreted with caution; (4) a daily GH substitution dose of 2 IU/m2 seems too high in many adult patients.<p>

Clinicians often do not agree whether a treatment is given with a palliative or curative intent. A common clear definition does not exist. This study has assessed the usefulness of dividing the goal of treatment into three distinct categories: curative treatment; palliative, symptom preventive treatment; and palliative, symptom relieving treatment. In a cross-sectional study among all cancer centres in Norway, a total of 629 patients were included into the study. Of these patients, 60% received palliative treatment, with an equal distribution between symptom preventive and symptom relieving. The definitions were found easy to use by the physicians. It gave important information of differences between cancer diagnosis with respect to the number of patients receiving palliative treatment. In order to refine the classification system, the authors will, in future studies, include a fourth category, life prolonging treatment, which is located between curative and palliative treatment with respect to treatment intensity.<p>

Autoimmune diseases (AD) represent usually a big challenge for the general physician (GP) and are often under diagnosed because of their rarity and their complex clinical symptoms. Even though AD are rapidly suspected, the GP is often exposed to the difficulty of screening and the complexity of the various biological tests at his disposal. This article propose the way to simplify the primary diagnostic approach of AD which often need a further specialized counseling necessary to determine the therapy.<p>

The authors examined the relation between a client's disclosure of emotional material in an analogue psychotherapy session and the depth and smoothness of that session. Transcripts of 33 prepracticum psychotherapy sessions (3 sessions each from 11 volunteer clients) were coded for client disclosures, and the text of these disclosures was subjected to a computer analysis to count the number of positive and negative emotion words. While controlling for client functioning, sessions in which clients disclosed more and used more positive-emotion words in their disclosures were rated as having more depth. Clients' use of emotion in their disclosures was not related to session smoothness. Findings from this study suggest aspects of client disclosure that are associated with deeper sessions.

The Kanzawa spider mite, Tetranychus kanzawai Kishida, is a major pest in tea fields [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] in Japan. However, recently, there have been some instances where acaricides are no longer applied as a result of the low occurrence of T. kanzawai in tea fields in Japan. In the period of 2015-2017, surveys of predatory mites in the study tea field detected Amblyseius eharai Amitai and Swirski, Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot, Euseius sojaensis (Ehara), Amblyseius obtuserellus Wainstein and Begljarov, and Typhlodromus vulgaris Ehara in tea fields, but not Neoseiulus womersleyi (Schicha), indicating that a major change in the composition of the phytoseiid mite population had occurred. In laboratory studies, we confirmed the ability to avoid synthetic pyrethroid insecticides of the major beneficial mites in tea fields, A. eharai and P. persimilis, but not of E. sojaensis, a predatory mite whose population declined heavily after pesticide application. Attempts are made in this study to associate the decrease in T. kanzawai frequency in Japan with changes in pesticide used, method of spraying, and composition of the phytoseiid mite population. By continuing the method of pesticide spraying ('partial surface'), which leaves refugia in the leaf layer with sub-lethal dosages of pesticide, phytoseiid mites are aided to evade pesticides, resulting in maintenance of the composition of the phytoseiid mite populations in terms of diversity and abundance. Maintaining the diversity and abundance of Phytoseiidae may have contributed to the stabilization of the T. kanzawai population at low densities in Japanese tea fields.<p>

Since spiders are sensitive to pesticides, the use of lower-volume pesticide sprays that specifically target the plucking surface may help to preserve their assemblages. In this study, we investigated the effect of four pyrethroid pesticides on spider populations in tea (Camellia sinensis) fields when applied using a lower-volume sprayer. Abundance and composition at family level of spiders were assessed before and after treatments. We found that fewer spiders were eliminated when we used a lower-volume sprayer (40 liters/10 ares) rather than a conventional sprayer (200 liters/10 ares) due to the lower-volume treatment only covering the plucking surface (top layer) of the tea plants. These findings indicate that the tea leaf layer plays a good role in sheltering spiders during pesticide application and that the lower-volume treatment that specifically targets the plucking surface can enhance this protection. Therefore, to successfully maintain predatory spiders that prey on tea pests, tea farmers should reduce the volume of pesticides they use and try to restrict the spray to the plucking surface of the plants.<p>

Infections with the intracellular bacterium Chlamydophila (C.) pecorum are highly prevalent worldwide in cattle. These infections cause significant diseases such as polyarthritis, pneumonia, enteritis, genital infections and fertility disorders, and occasionally sporadic bovine encephalomyelitis. Subclinical respiratory infections of calves with C. pecorum have been associated with airway obstruction, pulmonary inflammation, and reduced weight gains. This investigation examined four chlamydial strains with biological properties of C. pecorum isolated from feces of clinically normal cattle, from calves with pneumonia, and from bulls with posthitis. The objective was to characterize the evolutionary relationships of these bovine chlamydial isolates to other chlamydiae by genetic analysis of the ompA gene, and by the immunological cross-reactivities in Western immunoblot analysis. PCR typing of the ompA gene identified these isolates as C. pecorum. The OmpA-deduced amino acid dissimilarities between these four strains spanned 10-20%. In phylogenetic analysis, the four isolates clustered with C. pecorum ruminant, porcine, and koala strains of different geographic origins rather than with each other. All four isolates showed different patterns of Western immunoblot reactivity with antiserum against bovine C. pecorum strain LW63, and, interestingly, no cross-reactivity of the OmpA proteins with the anti-LW613 OmpA antibodies. These data underscore the polyphyletic population structure of C. pecorum and suggest that the spectrum of C. pecorum OmpA proteins in a host species can occupy the entire evolutionary bandwidth within C. pecorum. The variant immunoblot reactivities support the notion of considerable genomic plasticity of C. pecorum.<p>

The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib exhibits modest activity against acute myelogenous leukemia. To build on these results, we examined the effect of combining tipifarnib with other agents. Tipifarnib inhibited signaling downstream of the farnesylated small G protein Rheb and synergistically enhanced etoposide-induced antiproliferative effects in lymphohematopoietic cell lines and acute myelogenous leukemia isolates. We subsequently conducted a phase 1 trial of tipifarnib plus etoposide in adults over 70 years of age who were not candidates for conventional therapy. A total of 84 patients (median age, 77 years) received 224 cycles of oral tipifarnib (300-600 mg twice daily for 14 or 21 days) plus oral etoposide (100-200 mg daily on days 1-3 and 8-10). Dose-limiting toxicities occurred with 21-day tipifarnib. Complete remissions were achieved in 16 of 54 (30%) receiving 14-day tipifarnib versus 5 of 30 (17%) receiving 21-day tipifarnib. Complete remissions occurred in 50% of two 14-day tipifarnib cohorts: 3A (tipifarnib 600, etoposide 100) and 8A (tipifarnib 400, etoposide 200). In vivo, tipifarnib plus etoposide decreased ribosomal S6 protein phosphorylation and increased histone H2AX phosphorylation and apoptosis. Tipifarnib plus etoposide is a promising orally bioavailable regimen that warrants further evaluation in elderly adults who are not candidates for conventional induction chemotherapy. These clinical studies are registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00112853.<p>

The hepatic uptake of bile acids from the portal circulation is primarily dependent upon a sodium-dependent basolateral membrane transporter. In order to begin to investigate the factors controlling rat liver sodium-dependent bile acid cotransporter (ntcp) gene expression, we isolated approximately 30 kilobase pairs of rat genomic DNA in three overlapping lambdaphage clones. The rat ntcp gene is distributed over 16.5 kilobase pairs as five exons. Primer extension analysis revealed two closely spaced transcription initiation sites, 27 and 41 nucleotides downstream of a TATA sequence. Regulation of transcription was investigated first by transfection of primary rat hepatocytes by a series of 5'-deleted rat ntcp promoter-driven luciferase constructs (from approximately -6 kilobase pairs to -59 base pairs of upstream sequences, terminating at nucleotide +47), identifying a minimal promoter element: nucleotide -158 to +47. This minimal promoter was active in transfected HepG2, but inactive in NIH3T3, Caco-2, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, indicating that the determinants of hepatocyte-specific expression reside within this region. The individual elements within the minimal promoter were investigated via transfection of HepG2 cells by a series of 20 mutant plasmids, each containing a 10-base pair sequential block mutation. Eight mutant constructs profoundly suppressed promoter activity; encompassing sequences from -66 to +4 nt, and +15 to +24 nucleotides, while no other 10-base pair mutation significantly interfered with minimal promoter activity. Deoxyribonuclease I footprint analysis of the minimal promoter revealed three bound regions; -92 to -74 (footprint C), -50 to -37 (footprint B), and -17 to +12 (footprint A). Gel mobility shift assays provided evidence for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding within footprint A and a liver-enriched factor(s) that binds within a novel palindrome in footprint B. These studies indicate that three elements direct the basal and tissue-restricted expression of the rat ntcp promoter; a TATA element, the liver-enriched transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 1, and an unknown liver-enriched factor that binds within a novel palindrome in footprint B.<p>

Fas (CD95/Apo-1) ligand is a potent inducer of apoptosis and one of the major killing effector mechanisms of cytotoxic T cells. Thus, Fas ligand activity has to be tightly regulated, involving various transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes. For example, preformed Fas ligand is stored in secretory lysosomes of activated T cells, and rapidly released by degranulation upon reactivation. In this study, we analyzed the minimal requirements for activation-induced degranulation of Fas ligand. T cell receptor activation can be mimicked by calcium ionophore and phorbol ester. Unexpectedly, we found that stimulation with phorbol ester alone is sufficient to trigger Fas ligand release, whereas calcium ionophore is neither sufficient nor necessary. The relevance of this process was confirmed in primary CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and NK cells. Although the activation of protein kinase(s) was absolutely required for Fas ligand degranulation, protein kinase C or A were not involved. Previous reports have shown that preformed Fas ligand co-localizes with other markers of cytolytic granules. We found, however, that the activation-induced degranulation of Fas ligand has distinct requirements and involves different mechanisms than those of the granule markers CD63 and CD107a/Lamp-1. We conclude that activation-induced degranulation of Fas ligand in cytotoxic lymphocytes is differently regulated than other classical cytotoxic granule proteins.<p>

The mean minimal transit time for blood in muscle capillaries (tc) was estimated in six species, spanning two orders of magnitude in body mass and aerobic capacity: horse, steer, dog, goat, fox and agouti. Arterial (CaO2) and mixed venous (CvO2) blood O2 concentrations, blood hemoglobin concentrations ([Hb]) and oxygen uptake rates were measured while the animals ran on a treadmill at a speed that elicited the maximal oxygen consumption rate (VO2max) from each animal. Blood flow to the muscles (Qm) was assumed to be 85% of cardiac output, which was calculated using the Fick relationship. Total muscle capillary blood volume (Vc) and total muscle mitochondrial volume were estimated by morphometry, using a whole-body muscle sampling scheme. The tc was computed as Vc/Qm. The tc was 0.3-0.5 s in the 4 kg foxes and agoutis, 0.7-0.8 s in the 25 kg dogs and goats, and 0.8-1.0 s in the 400 kg horses and steers. The tc was positively correlated with body mass and negatively correlated with transcapillary O2 release rate per unit capillary length. Mitochondrial content was positively correlated with VO2max and with the product of Qm and [Hb]. These data suggested that Qm, Vc, maximal hemoglobin flux, and consequently tc, are co-adjusted to result in muscle O2 supply conditions that are matched to the O2 demands of the muscles at VO2max.<p>

44 patients with a range of parenchymal liver diseases diagnosed by biopsy or laboratory investigations underwent proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry of the liver at 0.08 T. T1 maps were produced using an interleaved saturation recovery and inversion recovery sequence and T2 maps using a four echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence. Significantly raised relaxation times compared with a previously studied group of 42 normal volunteers were found in groups of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (p &lt; 0.001 for T1 and T2), chronic active hepatitis (CAH) (p &lt; 0.01 for T1 and T2) and minor liver abnormalities (p &lt; 0.01, T2 only). T1 was significantly higher in cirrhotics than in patients with CAH (p &lt; 0.002) and minor abnormalities (p &lt; 0.001). This suggests a role for relaxometry in the confirmation of the presence of cirrhosis (sensitivity = 75%, specificity approximately 97%, taking T1 &gt; 266 ms as a positivity criterion). Reduced T2 values were found in patients with liver iron overload prior to venesection (p &lt; 0.001 versus normals, p &lt; 0.02 versus venesected patients). Although this latter test has relatively low sensitivity and specificity, it may have a role in the monitoring of treatment for iron overload.<p>

Cytogenetic analysis of an aggressive angiomyxoma of the vulvar region of a 16-year-old female revealed loss of one X chromosome (45,X,-X) in eight of 20 metaphase cells analyzed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) performed on disaggregated cells from paraffin embedded lesional tissue confirmed loss of an X chromosome in 31% of cells. Cytogenetic analysis performed on peripheral blood showed a normal chromosomal complement (46,XX). Thus, loss of one X chromosome appears to be confined to the neoplasm. This anomaly has not been previously described in aggressive angiomyxoma.<p>

A bilateral photochemically induced thrombotic lesion of rat sensorimotor cortex (approximately 3 mm in diameter and 25 mm3 in volume) is associated with a persistent cognition (learning and memory) deficit, which was evaluated with water maze tasks. The N-dichloroacetylsphingosine derivative of lysoGM1 (LIGA20) administered after the lesion either i.v. or per or reduces the infarct size by 30-40% and attenuates the associated cognition deficits, presumably by limiting the extent of damage of neurons at risk located in the surroundings of the infarcted core (i.e., area penumbra). The LIGA20 protection is dose and time dependent. Maximal protection is afforded by a single dose of LIGA20 of 34 mumol/kg i.v. 1 hr after lesion or by a dose of 270 mumol/kg per os when administered 1 hr and 24 hr after the lesion. The protective effect of LIGA20 can be observed when the drug is administered i.v. up to 6 hr after the lesion. The protective efficacy of the oral administration of LIGA20 is related to its physiochemical properties, which, unlike those of GM1, allow absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. LIGA20 given orally reaches the brain promptly and rapidly inserts into the neuronal membranes. Here, by an unknown molecular mechanism, LIGA20 selectively reduces the pathological amplification of Ca2+ signaling elicited by persistent stimulation of ionotropic glutamate receptors in the area penumbra.<p>

The occurrence of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals with high CD4+ counts indicates poor immunologic function. Thrush and persistent fever, easily recognized clinically, are potential measures of immunocompetence. This analysis establishes the complex interactions of CD4+ count, thrush, and persistent fever to predict the occurrence of PCP. Analyses used 20,632 person visits from 2,568 HIV-1-seropositive homosexual or bisexual men participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Comprehensive examinations were conducted semiannually, while occurrences of PCP were assessed continuously. The occurrence of thrush and fever increase in frequency as CD4+ levels decrease. The relative hazard of PCP in the presence of thrush compared with the absence of thrush rises (p &lt; 0.05) from 1 for the lowest CD4+ category to approximately 5 in the highest categories. The relative hazard of PCP in the presence of fever compared with the absence of fever is above one (p &lt; 0.05) in all CD4+ categories. No cases of PCP occurred in individuals on PCP prophylaxis with CD4+ counts &gt; 200/mm3. These results suggest that HIV-1-related symptoms provide a measure of failing immune function that is not reflected by enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes alone and support the United States Public Health Service recommendation that symptomatic individuals with CD4+ counts &gt; 200/mm3 should be considered for PCP prophylaxis.<p>

To supplement sparse data about ischemic heart disease in Asian Americans, hospitalization risk was prospectively examined in a group of Asian Americans living in Northern California. Analyses used Cox models with ischemic heart disease risk traits as covariables. With Whites as the referent category, relative risks by ethnic group were as follows: Chinese, 0.6 (P = .001); Japanese, 1.0 (P = .97); Filipinos, 1.0 (P = .95); South Asians, 3.7 (P &lt; .001); other Asian Americans, 0.8 (P = .55). Thus, unexplained differences in ischemic heart disease risk exist among Asian-American ethnic groups, with Chinese Americans at lowest risk and persons of South Asian origin at highest risk.<p>

AIMS: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical impact of left atrial (LA) thrombus and dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and low CHADS(2) score undergoing cardioversion. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 295 consecutive patients with non-valvular AF and a CHADS(2) score of 0 or 1 from the prospective single-centre registry ANTIK, who underwent transoesophageal echocardiography before cardioversion, were included in the study. Median follow-up was 5 years. LA thrombus was present in 3% and dense SEC in 8% of patients. Independent predictors for the presence of thrombus or dense SEC were ejection fraction (EF) &lt;40% and LA diameter &gt; or =50 mm. In anticoagulated patients, thrombus and dense SEC were not independently associated with an increased risk for stroke or death during the 5 year follow-up (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.50-4.83). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a low CHADS(2) score of 0/1, 3% of patients have LA thrombus and 8% of patients have dense SEC. Independent predictors for the presence of thrombus and dense SEC were EF &lt;40% and LA dimension &gt; or =50 mm. Thus, echocardiography might be a useful tool for further risk stratification in patients with low CHADS(2) score.<p>

Knowledge of factors relevant for medication adherence and patient collaboration is still limited. Our study aims at exploring the contribution of a variety of factors to collaboration in outpatients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. We obtained self-rated and observer-rated data from 108 outpatients during an interview 6 months after hospital discharge. The compliance rating scale (CRS) classified 76% of the patients as collaborative. Factors related to the patient, illness, treatment, and social environment were analysed in two-step explorative correlation and regression analyses in order to determine their relative contribution to collaboration. Only trust in medication and lack of insight were associated with collaboration, and they accounted for 38% of the variance. Neither medication side effects nor neuropsychological functioning correlated with collaboration. The conceptualisation of medication adherence is complex, and there are a number of unresolved methodological problems. The data indicate that illness and treatment-related subjective attitudes may be more relevant than side effects, cognitive functioning or any sociodemographic variable.<p>

INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is equivalent to adjuvant therapy (AdC) in terms of survival and disease-free interval. Many institutions add AdC after NAC and surgery. However, such extended chemotherapy (ExC) is not evidence based. Study aim was to investigate if ExC improved disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1998 to 2006 356 consecutive patients received NAC (45 pts), AdC (221 pts) or ExC (90 pts). We analysed these 3 groups to determine effects of ExC and to identify patients who might benefit. NAC consisted in 93% of 3-6 cycles of epirubicin+docetaxel, AdC comprised EC+/-taxanes in 72%. Median age in the NAC, AdC, and ExC-groups was 54, 56 and 52 years with follow-up of 30, 57, and 55 months. RESULTS: After NAC, 35% achieved downstaging and 10% pathologic complete remission. Surprisingly ExC seemed to result in reduction of 5-year DFS: compared to 85% and 82% after NAC and AdC, DFS was 61% after ExC (p=0.001). OS was not significantly affected (79, 91, and 78% after NAC, AdC and ExC, p=0.13). In multivariate analysis after correction for age, menopausal status, stage, grading, hormone receptors, her2-status, radiotherapy and surgery, ExC seemed to adversely affect DFS (HR 2.15, p=0.008), loco-regional and distant recurrence-rates (HR 3.0, p=0.03 and HR 2.0, p=0.02). DISCUSSION: In this single-center analysis ExC could not show advantages in terms of DFS and OS. Because multivariate analyses of retrospective data cannot account for all potential biases, these data require confirmation in randomized clinical trials. Until then, extended chemotherapy should be considered carefully. As in previous studies, no differences were found between NAC and AdC groups.<p>

(1996). &quot;Constitutive expression of the gene for the cell-specific p48 DNA-binding subunit of pancreas transcription factor 1 in cultured cells is under control of binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and alphaCbf.&quot; <u>Journal of Biological Chemistry</u> <b>271</b>(36): 21993-22002.<p>
We have cloned and characterized the rat gene that encodes the p48 DNA-binding subunit of pancreas transcription factor 1 (Ptf1), a cell-specific basic region helix-loop-helix (bHLH) protein. The ptf1-p48 gene measures 1.8 kilobases in size and occurs as a single copy in the haploid genome. Run-on transcription assays suggest that this gene is subject to transcriptional control since no activity of its promoter is detected in nonproducing cells. The gene specifies two mRNAs that encode the same protein and originate from transcription initiation at alternative sites. Expression analysis of hybrid genes bearing deletions of the gene's 5'-flanking region fused to a reporter gene defines a promoter region within the gene-proximal 260 base pairs of DNA. The cis-acting elements that control promoter activity include binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and alphaCbf, a 60-kDa CCAAT box-binding protein. The gene promoter, however, functions not only in exocrine pancreatic cells but also in cells of other origin. No cell-specific transcriptional control element was detected in as much as 10 kilobases of 5'-flanking region. We discuss models of how the cell-specific expression of the endogenous ptf1-p48 gene might be established during development of the animal.<p>

Koenig, A. M., et al. (2009). &quot;Strong impact of micrometastatic tumor cell load in patients with esophageal carcinoma.&quot; <u>Annals of Surgical Oncology</u> <b>16</b>(2): 454-462.<p>
BACKGROUND: To assess the role of immunohistochemically detectable nodal microinvolvement of patients with &quot;curatively&quot; resected esophageal carcinoma. METHODS: In 73 patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), n = 45 (61.6%); adenocarcinoma (AC), n = 28 (38.4%)] a total of 2174 lymph nodes (LN) were removed. In each of the 1958 LN classified as negative on conventional histopathology, immunohistochemistry was performed using the anticytokeratin antibody AE1/AE3. To determine the role of the amount of residual tumor load, the patients were grouped according to the percentage of LN affected with micrometastasis (0%, &lt;11%, and &gt; or =11%). RESULTS: Tumor cells were immunohistochemically detected in 47 LN (2.4%) from 25 (34.2%) patients. Five-year overall survival probability (5-YSP) of 30% in pN(0 )patients with detected occult tumor cells in LN was significantly worse than that in those without nodal microinvolvement (76%, P = 0.021), hereby resembling that of pN1-patients (24%, P = 0.84). Median overall survival in patients with no (0%), low (&lt;11%), and high (&gt;11%) micrometastatic tumor load was 43, 27, and 11 months, respectively. Substratification according to histological type showed that, in patients with AC, the presence of nodal microinvolvement had a significant impact on 5-YSP (0% versus 65%; P = 0.03), whereas in patients with SCC, differences of 5-YSP were only of borderline significance (24% versus 53%; P = 0.081). CONCLUSION: Minimal tumor cell load as assessed by the ratio of micrometastatically affected LN is a complementary tool for better risk stratification of patients with esophageal carcinoma.<p>

It has previously been demonstrated that patients with heart failure (HF) in an urban public hospital had significant gaps in knowledge regarding dietary sodium restriction. The objective of this study was to determine what risk factors were associated with such gaps in knowledge and to determine if these gaps in knowledge would increase the risk for HF readmission. A standardized test of sodium knowledge (scored 0 to 10) was administered prospectively to 97 hospitalized patients with HF &lt;48 hours before discharge. The incidence of 90-day hospital readmission for HF was compared between subjects with low dietary sodium knowledge (score 0 to 3) and the remainder of the cohort (score 4 to 10) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Another 48 patients with HF were prospectively recruited, and the dietary sodium knowledge test and a survey of psychosocial and other parameters, including the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, a validated measure of health literacy, were administered. The 90-day readmission rate for HF was 3 times higher in those with low sodium knowledge than in the remainder of the cohort (28% vs 9%, p = 0.02). This association persisted in multivariate models adjusting for potential confounders. Low health literacy, but not other psychosocial parameters, was associated with low dietary sodium knowledge. In conclusion, low dietary sodium knowledge was an independent risk factor for 90-day HF hospital readmission in the urban setting. Deficiency in dietary sodium knowledge is one pathway through which low health literacy leads to adverse outcomes in patients with HF.<p>

A dynamic headspace-gas chromatography (HS/GC) method was developed to quantitate benzene in recycled PETE material derived from 21 PETE beverage bottles. The analytical system consisted of a purge-and-trap apparatus which was interfaced directly with a gas chromatograph/flame ionization detector. Cryofocusing and non-cryofocusing GC systems were used. The technique was applied to spiked PETE test samples which were prepared at various benzene concentrations ranging from 100 ppb to 117 ppm. The initial spiked benzene concentration in the PETE test samples was determined gravimetrically. The HS/GC technique was limited by the slow desorption rate of benzene from the PETE matrix; as a result, multipurges were performed at 60 degrees C. Regression analysis was done on the multipurge data to develop a desorption model which would predict the total amount of benzene in the PETE. The calculated results agreed with the experimental recoveries within +/- 10%. Recovery depended on the initial benzene level in the PETE and ranged from 70 to 90% after the first five purges.<p>

Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a mycotoxin produced by mold. It mainly causes nephropathies in humans and domestic animals as a major pathogenic contaminant of cereals and animal feed. Upon p.o. uptake and intestinal absorption, a large part of OTA is taken up by hepatocytes and eliminated into bile. In the present study, hepatocellular uptake of radiolabeled [3H]OTA in isolated rat hepatocytes was characterized; a saturable (K(m) = 18.9 microM, Vmax = 473 pmol/mg/min), temperature (Aapp = 30.4 and 76.6 kilo Joule/mol) and energy-dependent mycotoxin transport was found. This OTA uptake was inhibited by various bile acids, sulfobromophthalein and the thrombin inhibitor CRC 220. Because all inhibitors are substrates of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (oatp), a recently cloned hepatic carrier, uptake experiments were performed in oatp-cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes. These studies revealed an oatp-specific OTA uptake (K(m) = 16.6 microM). In contrast, OTA was not transported by the hepatic Na+/taurocholate-cotransporting polypeptide. Known oatp substrates cis-inhibited OTA uptake in oatp-cRNA-injected oocytes in close correlation with the results derived from isolated hepatocytes. These results identify OTA as a new substrate for oatp. They further support the multispecific nature of oatp-mediated transport and stress the importance of this carrier for hepatic clearance of xenobiotics.<p>

In a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we considered the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in view of raised serum aminotransferases, hypergammaglobulinaemia, antinuclear antibodies (titre 1:10,240), seronegativity of markers for viral hepatitis and absence of recent hepatotoxic drug usage. The diagnosis of AIH was supported by using the scoring system, recently developed by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group and the excellent response to treatment with prednisone. Liver histology, however, showed no characteristic features of AIH. The relevance of liver histology and scoring for AIH in SLE with hepatic involvement is discussed.<p>

Recent work on adult metacognition indicates that although metacognitive monitoring often guides control operations, sometimes it follows control operations and is based on the feedback from them. Consistent with this view, in self-paced learning, judgments of learning (JOLs) made at the end of each study trial decreased with the amount of time spent studying the item, suggesting that JOLs are based on the memorizing effort heuristic that easily learned items are more likely to be remembered. Study 1 extended investigation to primary school children. Whereas for third to sixth graders (9- to 12-year-olds) JOLs decreased with increasing study time (ST), no such relationship was found for first and second graders (7- and 8-year-olds). For both age groups, however, recall decreased with ST, supporting the validity of the memorizing effort heuristic. Self-reports (Study 2) disclosed the belief that recall should tend to increase with ST. The results bring to the fore the importance of mnemonic cues that shape metacognitive feelings even among primary school children. These cues lie in the very feedback that learners gain on-line from task performance rather than in metacognitive knowledge, and their use may also contribute to increased monitoring accuracy with age.<p>

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) have been implicated in the inflammation-dependent sensitization of nociceptors, and the inflammatory mediator bradykinin (BK) led to a reduced threshold in the nociceptor terminals, activating intracellular signaling by phosphorylating receptors and ion channels. The effects of BK on the non-transcriptional modulation of the ERK1/2 in the peripheral nociceptor terminals, including in nerve endings of the dentin-pulp complex, are unknown. The time-dependent effects of BK (10(-7) M) on the ERK1/2 phosphorylation in nerve terminals of the dentin-pulp complex were investigated by quantitative and double immunolabeling with organ bath experiments. In nerve terminals, total and p-ERK1/2 were detected. In comparison with the controls, the numbers of p-ERK1/2-positive nerve endings increased after 1 and 3 min and decreased after 10 min of BK treatment. Analysis of the data indicates that BK induces phosphorylation-mediated local activation of ERK1/2 in nerve terminals modulating nociception in the dentin-pulp complex.<p>

Oosorption, resorption of developing oocytes in the ovary, in P. c. stali is characterized by changes in appearance of oocytes from opaque greyish green or orange to transparent, degeneration of yolk granules and disappearance of oocyte contents. Starvation and virginity were indicated to be factors that induce oosorption. SDS PAGE/Western blotting analysis using anti-vitellogenin antiserum detected two major and many minor bands in haemolymph samples. Egg extracts showed a more complicated set of positive bands in the same analysis. Yolk protein, vitellin, therefore, seemed to be formed after complicated processing of vitellogenin following its uptake by the oocytes. In starved, oosorption-induced females, vitellogenin concentration in the haemolymph was lower than that of fed females, and Western blotting failed to detect either oosorption-specific or ovary-specific peptide fragments in haemolymph samples collected from those females. These results suggest that once oosorption was induced vitellogenin/vitellin in oocytes was degraded rapidly and released into the haemolymph in the form of amino acids or small peptides too small to be recognized by the anti-vitellogenin antiserum.<p>

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of different air-abrasion devices on substance loss on flattened enamel, preparation extent, and microleakage of invasive pit and fissure sealings. METHODS: 150 freshly extracted caries-free human third molars were used. 60 teeth (n = 10) were embedded, enamel surfaces were polished to #1200, and six air abrasion devices abraded specimens for 5 seconds. Substance loss was profilometrically recorded as maximum and mean width, and maximum and mean depth. From 90 intact teeth (n = 10), fissures were enlarged by air abrasion (Rondoflex 27 microm/50 microm, Airsonic Mini Sandblaster, CoJet Prep, PrepStart, Primus CPE), or treated with a diamond bur (De Craene), or using a metal bur (Fissurotomy Micro NTF), or with oscillating diamond tips (SONICSeal). Prepared fissures were etched and rinsed and sealed with a light-curing sealant (Helioseal). After four weeks water storage and subsequent 2,000 thermocycles (5 degrees C/55 degrees C), microleakage was assessed with 5% methylene blue for 3 minutes at 30G on cross cuts at x40 magnification. Furthermore the parameters upper fissure width, prepared and unprepared area, penetration depth of the sealer, and area of voids were recorded. RESULTS: For substance loss on flattened enamel, CoJet Prep and Mini Sandblaster revealed the widest abrasion areas, PrepStart produced the deepest craters (P &lt; 0.05). Regarding preparation characteristics, rotary burs and PrepStart caused significantly less substance loss than the other devices (P &lt; 0.05). Due to the etch&amp;rinse approach, microleakage was generally minimal. Only after air abrasion with Rondoflex (50 microm) significantly less complete sealings were recorded (P &lt; 0.05).<p>

Ultrasound examination is a valuable diagnostic tool in almost all medical disciplines. However, the results are highly dependent on the experience and performance of the individual examiner and the technical conditions of the examination. Since computed tomography (CT) is not affected by these factors, the combination of real-time ultrasound images and previously compiled CT scans with identical cross-sections displayed simultaneously during transcutaneous ultrasonography could be advantageous. To evaluate the practical applicability and reliability of CT-supported transcutaneous ultrasonography, we examined 10 patients with a Real-Time Virtual Sonography Unit using a previously compiled CT scan as a reference. The results were evaluated by 10 sonographers with different levels of experience. By using the 3-point registration method almost identical ultrasound and CT cross-sections were displayed throughout the examination. However, there was a constant lateral and height deviation of the CT image detected. The crucial point is the correct and reliable referencing of the real-time ultrasound. In conclusion, the CT-navigated ultrasound seems not yet complete for clinical applications. Although helpful for training purposes, it is not accurate enough yet to play a role in routine clinical diagnostic work up.<p>

We report the isolation of cDNA for the p48 DNA-binding subunit of the heterooligomeric transcription factor PTF1. A sequence analysis of the cDNA demonstrates that p48 is a new member of the family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors. The p48 bHLH domain shows striking amino acid sequence similarity with the bHLH domain of proteins that act as developmental regulators, including the twist gene product, myogenic factors and proteins involved in hematopoietic differentiation. We show that reduced p48 synthesis correlates with a diminished expression of genes encoding exocrine pancreas-specific functions. The synthesis of p48 mRNAs, and therefore also the protein, is restricted to cells of the exocrine pancreas in the adult and to the pancreatic primordium in the embryo. Thus the pancreas-specific DNA-binding activity of PTF1 originates from the synthesis of at least one cell-specific component rather than from a cell-specific assembly of more widely distributed proteins.<p>

Non-melanocytic skin cancer has long been regarded as one of the harmful effects of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation on human health. In this review, we examine epidemiologic evidence linking sun exposure and skin cancer coming from both descriptive studies in populations and analytical studies involving estimates of exposure in individuals. Particular attention is given to the quality of the published data. The epidemiologic evidence that sun exposure causes skin cancer is mainly indirect. Incidence or mortality is inversely related to latitude in populations of mainly European origin (e.g., the United States, Australia), and is higher in people born in Australia (high ambient solar radiation) than in migrants to Australia from the United Kingdom (lower ambient radiation). Skin cancer occurs mainly at sun-exposed body sites and in people who are sensitive to the sun; a reduced capacity to repair UV-induced DNA damage appears to increase the risk. The direct evidence linking sun exposure and skin cancer is weaker with few well-conducted studies of sun exposure in individuals. Mostly, studies of total sun exposure have not found statistically significant positive associations; those that did, had not adjusted for potential confounding by age and gender and thus their interpretation is limited. Studies of occupational sun exposure had relative risks not greater than 2.0; recreational exposure has been little studied. Other measurements, less direct but potentially less prone to measurement error, are sunburn (not evidently associated with skin cancer risk) and indicators of benign cutaneous sun-damage (strongly associated but lacking empirical evidence that sun exposure is their main cause). Many questions remain about the relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer.<p>

The white matter of resected temporal lobes from patients with intractable complex partial seizures shows increased cellularity which appears to be related to glia and neurons. This study, using quantitative methods, defines an increase in glial cell numbers and a significant increase in glial nuclear size within a defined area of white matter in the lateral temporal lobe. Evaluation was made on specimens from ten patients with complex partial seizures compared with two patients with non-epileptic brain lesions and five autopsy patients with no neurologic disease. The importance of recognizing these alterations in glia and the possible relevance to the pathoetiology of epilepsy are discussed.<p>

The Cu ligand Met121 in azurin of Alcaligenes denitrificans was mutated to His. The spectroscopic and mechanistic properties of [M121H]azurin appear to be pH dependent with a pKa of 3.8 due to the ionization of His121. The [M121H]azurin mutant exhibits two major distinct metal-site-coordination geometries which coexist in solution according to pH-dependent equilibrium. Both species have been spectroscopically characterized by ultraviolet-visible, EPR and resonance Raman spectroscopies. At neutral pH, His121 is deprotonated and acts as the fourth ligand of the Cu; the spectroscopic characteristics of the Cu site at this pH are halfway between those of a type-1 and a type-2 Cu site, and the site is referred to as a type-1.5 or intermediate Cu site. The spectral data are compatible with a tetrahedral geometry of this site. At low pH, the spectroscopic data indicate that [M121H]azurin has a trigonal type-1 rhombic Cu site.<p>

Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with exaggerated oscillatory synchrony in the basal ganglia at frequencies over 8-35 Hz. Studies have demonstrated a suppression of local field potential (LFP) activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) upon treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa, with the degree of suppression of power in the 8-35 Hz band correlating with the improvement in combined measures of bradykinesia and rigidity. However, these studies do not explicitly address the question of what is more important in predicting clinical change - synchronisation of neuronal activity or the specific frequency within the 8-35 Hz band over which the latter occurs. In addition, they have not demonstrated a relationship between treatment-induced changes in synchronisation and changes in bradykinesia or rigidity on their own. To this end, we collected and analysed LFP and clinical data in 30 patients with PD. We found significant correlations between levodopa-induced power suppression and rigidity and bradykinesia, when these clinical features were considered separately, but only when power suppression profiles were re-aligned to the frequency of peak synchronisation. Under these circumstances correlations with rigidity persisted despite partialising out the effect of bradykinesia and vice versa. These data suggest that levodopa-induced improvements in both rigidity and bradykinesia scale with the degree of suppression of oscillatory power in the STN LFP, and that this is true irrespective of the frequency at which synchronisation occurs across a broad band from 8-35 Hz.<p>

A new family of antimicrobial peptides was isolated from the venom of Cupiennius salei. The peptides were purified to homogeneity, and the sequence of cupiennin 1a was determined by Edman degradation: GFGALFKFLAKKVAKTVAKQAAKQGAKYVVNKQME-NH(2). The amino acid sequences of cupiennin 1b, c, and d were obtained by a combination of sequence analysis and mass spectrometric measurements of comparative tryptic peptide mapping. All peptides consist of 35 amino acid residues and are characterized by a more hydrophobic N-terminal chain region and a C terminus composed preferentially of polar and charged residues. The total charge of all cupiennins calculated under physiological conditions is +8, and their C terminus, formed by a glutamic acid residue, is amidated. Conformational studies of the peptides revealed a high helix forming potential. Antimicrobial assays on bacteria with cupiennin 1a, 1d, and synthesized cupiennins 1a* and 1d* showed minimal inhibitory concentrations for bacteria in the submicromolar range. Their lytic effect on human red blood cells was lower by a factor of 8 to 14 than the highly hemolytic melittin. Cupiennin 1a, 1b, 1d, 1a*, and 1d* showed pronounced insecticidal activity. The immediate biological effects and the structural properties of the isolated cupiennins indicate a membrane-destroying mode of action on prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells.<p>

A phospholipid translocating protein from rat liver has been expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Injection of oocytes with total rat liver messenger RNA (mRNA) resulted in the function expression of saturable uptake of the water soluble phophatidylcholine derivative L-alpha-dibutyroylglycero-3-phophatidylcholine (diC4PC), Kinetic studies revealed an apparent Km value of approximately 10 mmol/L, which is similar to the value previously obtained in isolated rat liver canalicular plasma membrane vesicles for an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-independent phosphatidylcholine translocator. Size fractionation of total rat liver mRNA yielded an active mRNA species between 1.8 and 2.6 kb, that stimulated the expressed phophatidylcholine uptake activity approximately fivefold as compared with differently sized mRNA subfractions. This active mRNA size class is too small to code for the mdr2 P-glycoprotein, which has been suggested to function as an ATP-dependent canalicular phosphatidylcholine translocator. Hence, the data indicate that there are at least two separate polypeptides involved in phospholipid translocation from hepatocytes into bile.<p>

OBJECTIVES: To detect the prevalence of HIV-co-infection in patients with ocular syphilis and to compare ocular syphilis in HIV-positive and -negative patients. METHODS: 24 consecutive patients treated for ocular syphilis at our hospital between 1998 and 2006 were evaluated retrospectively. Patients' characteristics, laboratory results (including syphilis serology, HIV status, CSF examination), major ophthalmologic finding, treatment and course were assessed. Data of HIV-positive and -negative patients were compared. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients with ocular syphilis, 11 were co-infected with HIV. Notably, the HIV-infection had previously been unknown in 7 of the 11 HIV-positive patients. 6 of these were in an early disease stage (CDC category A). Clinical and laboratory findings did not differ between HIV-positive and -negative patients except for the C-reactive protein (CRP), which was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular syphilis led to new diagnosis of HIV-infection in an unexpectedly high number of patients, which emphasises that patients with ocular syphilis must be screened for HIV-co-infection. According to our study the expected benefit is high because most of the patients newly diagnosed with HIV had high CD4(+) cell counts. These patients can be monitored and treated before the development of AIDS.<p>

To assess the relation between early acute otitis media and exposure to respiratory pathogens mediated by siblings and other children, a prospective cohort of 3754 Norwegian children born in 1992-3 was followed up from birth to 12 months. Of these, 25% had one or more episodes of acute otitis media during the first year. Results from multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for confounding showed that siblings' attendance at daycare is the most important risk factor for early acute otitis media (adjusted odds ratio, ORadj = 1.9). The total number of children in the daycare setting is another determinant for early acute otitis media (ORadj = 2.0 in groups of four or more other children and ORadj = 1.3 in groups of one to three other children, as compared to those who are cared for alone). Having siblings in daycare outside the home and the number of children in the daycare setting are the most important determinants for early acute otitis media.<p>

ISG15 functions as a critical antiviral molecule against influenza virus, with infection inducing both the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins and production of free ISG15. Here, we report that mice lacking the ISG15 E1 enzyme UbE1L fail to form ISG15 conjugates. Both UbE1L(-/-) and ISG15(-/-) mice display increased susceptibility to influenza B virus infection, including non-mouse-adapted strains. Finally, we demonstrate that ISG15 controls influenza B virus infection through its action within radioresistant stromal cells and not bone marrow-derived cells. Thus, the conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins within stromal cells is critical to its activity against influenza virus.<p>

Two non-cationic defensin-like antimicrobial peptides, named Amblyomma defensin peptide 1 and Amblyomma defensin peptide 2, were identified from the hard tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, by a combination of suppression subtractive hybridization for differentially expressed genes and proteomics. cDNA clones encoding each of these two defensin-like antimicrobial peptides were isolated from the differentially expressed cDNA library of the tick synganglia (central nervous system). The preproproteins deduced from the cDNA sequences each have 92 amino acid residues. Amblyomma defensin peptide 2 was purified from the haemolymph of fed female ticks. The purified peptide displayed antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Amblyomma defensin peptide 1 was further identified by protein chip capture combined with SELDI-TOF (surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight) MS. By screening for differentially expressed proteins, it was found that the expression of Amblyomma defensin peptide 1 was upregulated during 4 days post-feeding. Our findings firstly provide two defensin-like antimicrobial peptides that are particularly novel in being anionic, together with corresponding cDNA sequences, in hard ticks, and prove that the combination of suppression subtractive hybridization and protein profiling is a powerful method to study differentially expressed proteins, especially for organisms without available genome sequence information.<p>

In oviparous species, proteins and lipids found in the vitellus form the lipoproteins called lipovitellins that are the major source of energy for the development, growth, and survival of the embryo. The energy resources provided by the lipovitellins have not yet been investigated in the Order Araneae. Using the wolf spider Schizocosa malitiosa (Lycosidae) as an experimental model, we identified and characterized the lipovitellins present in the cytosol, focusing on the energetic contribution of those lipoprotein particles in the vitellus. Two lipovitellins (LV) named SmLV1 and SmLV2 were isolated. SmLV1 is a high-density lipoprotein with 67% lipid and 3.6% carbohydrate, and SmLV2 is a very high-density lipoprotein with 9% lipid and 8.8% carbohydrate. Through electrophoresis in native conditions we observed that SmLV1 has a molecular mass of 559 kDa composed of three apolipoproteins of 116, 87, and 42 kDa, respectively. SmLV2 comprised several proteins composed of different proportions of the same subunits (135, 126, 109, and 70 kDa). The principal lipids of these lipovitellins are sphingomyelin + lysophosphatidylcholine, esterified sterols, and phosphatidylcholine. Lipovitellin-free cytosol contains abundant phospatidylcholine and triacylglyceride related to the yolk nuclei (the vitellus organizing center). The principal fatty acids of SmLV1 and SmLV2 are 18:2 n-6, 18:1 n-9, and 16:0. Spectrophotometry detected no pigments in either the lipovitellins or the cytosol. The egg caloric content was 92 cal/g, at proportions of 59.8% protein, 20.1% carbohydrate, and 19.9% lipid. SmLV1 and SmLV2 provided 19.5% and 17.1% of the calories, respectively. Both lipovitellins contribute mainly with proteins (15.8-18%), with the input of carbohydrates and lipids being lower than 1.3%.<p>

The aim of this study was to evaluate energetic source used by juveniles of a terrestrial oviparous invertebrate during the earliest periods of their life. Growth, behavioural activities and energy contents of Pardosa saltans spiderlings' residual vitellus were monitored during 8 days after their emergence from their egg-sac until they disperse autonomously. The life-cycle of juvenile after emergence can be divided into three periods: a gregarious while juveniles are aggregated on their mother, dismounting off their mother's back and dispersion. We present the first biochemical study of residual vitellus and energy expenditure during these three periods. At emergence, the mean weight of juveniles was 0.59 mg and energy stock from residual vitellus averaged 51 cal/g wet mass. During gregarious period, the weight of the juveniles aggregated on their mother did not vary significantly and juveniles utilized only 1 cal/day from their residual vitellus. During the period from dismounting until their first exogenous feed, juveniles lost weight and used 30% of their residual vitellus stock. Proteins from the residual vitellus contributed principally to their energy expenditure during this period: 1.5 microg protein/day. Juveniles' first exogenous feeding was observed 7-8 days after emergence, when 70% of residual vitellus energy had been utilized. Juveniles dispersed after eating, reconstituting an energy stock comparable to that observed at emergence from egg-sac (50 cal/g wet mass). This new energy stock contains mainly lipids unlike the energy stock from the residual vitellus.<p>

The importance of midgut diverticula (M-diverticula) and hemolymph lipoproteins in the lipid homeostasis of Polybetes phythagoricus was studied. Radioactivity distribution in tissues and hemolymph was analyzed either after feeding or injecting [1-(14)C]-palmitate. In both experiments, radioactivity was mostly taken up by M-diverticula that synthesized diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols and phospholipids in a ratio close to its lipid class composition. M-diverticula total lipids represent 8.08% (by wt), mostly triacylglycerols (74%) and phosphatidylcholine (13%). Major fatty acids were (in decreasing order of abundance) 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 16:0, 16:1n-7, 18:0, 18:3n-3. Spider hemocyanin-containing lipoprotein (VHDL) transported 83% of the circulating label at short incubation times. After 24h, VHDL and HDL-1 (comparable to insect lipophorin) were found to be involved in the lipid uptake and release from M-diverticula, HDL-2 playing a negligible role. Lipoprotein's labelled lipid changed with time, phospholipids becoming the main circulating lipid after 24h. These results indicate that arachnid M-diverticula play a central role in lipid synthesis, storage and movilization, analogous to insect fat body or crustacean midgut gland. The relative contribution of HDL-1 and VHDL to lipid dynamics indicated that, unlike insects, spider VHDL significantly contributes to the lipid exchange between M-diverticula and hemolymph.<p>

It has been already reported that most hemolymphatic lipids in the spider Polybetes pythagoricus are transported by HDL1 and VHDL lipoproteins. We studied in vitro the lipid transfer among midgut-diverticula (M-diverticula), and either hemolymph or purified lipoproteins as well as between hemolymphatic lipoproteins. M-diverticula and hemolymph were labeled by in vivo (14)C-palmitic acid injection. In vitro incubations were performed between M-diverticula and either hemolymph or isolated lipoproteins. Hemolymph lipid uptake was associated to HDL1 (67%) and VHDL (32%). Release from hemolymph towards M-diverticula showed the opposite trend, VHDL 75% and HDL1 45%. Isolated lipoproteins showed a similar behavior to that observed with whole hemolymph. Lipid transfer between lipoproteins showed that HDL1 transfer more (14)C-lipids to VHDL than vice versa. Only 38% FFA and 18% TAG were transferred from M-diverticula to lipoproteins, while on the contrary 75% and 73% of these lipids, respectively, were taken up from hemolymph. A similar trend was observed regarding lipoprotein phospholipids. This study supports the hypothesis that HDL1 and hemocyanin-containing VHDL are involved in the uptake and release of FFA, phospholipids and triacylglycerols in the spider P. pythagoricus. The data support a directional flow of lipids from HDL1 and VHDL suggesting a mode of lipid transport between lipoproteins and M-diverticula.<p>

Despite vitellins being essential yolk proteins, their presence in spiders remains almost unknown. Two vitellins from the spider Polybetes pythagoricus, named LV1 and LV2, were isolated and their size, shape, lipids, fatty acids, proteins and carbohydrates moieties were determined. LV1 has a density similar to that of HDL with 49.3% lipids, and LV2 has a density similar to that of VHDL with 9.7% lipids. The major neutral lipid present in both vitellins was found to be esterified cholesterol, 16% for LV1 and 24% for LV2. The major fatty acid was 18:1n-9 in LV1 and LV2. Results from native PAGE showed a lipoprotein of 550 kDa for LV1 and three lipoproteins of 571, 400 and 257 kDa for LV2. SDS-PAGE evidenced two major apolipoproteins of 64 and 25 kDa in LV1. The three lipoproteins of LV2 were electroeluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, showing different proportions of the same apolipoproteins (181, 67 and 60 kDa). LVs were analyzed by spectrophotometry, immunochemical and electron microscopy, showing that the respiratory pigment hemocyanin was not present as apolipoprotein. This fact evidenced that these LVs were not related to hemolymphatic lipoproteins.<p>

Hemocyanin of the spider Polybetes pythagoricus, in addition to its typical role as an oxygen transporter, also exhibits a phenoloxidase activity induced by micellar concentrations of SDS. In the present work, we found the kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of Polybetes pythagoricus hemocyanin (PpHc) PO activity to be 0.407 mM and 0.081 micromolmin(-1) mg protein(-1) , respectively. Dopamine was used as the substrate with SDS at a final concentration of 10 mM and a 30-min incubation at 25 degrees C. Conformational changes in Hc associated with the SDS treatment were analyzed using far-UV circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. The secondary and tertiary structural changes of PpHc induced by SDS led to increases in alpha-helical content and tryptophan fluorescence intensity. A reduction in the absorption spectrum at 340 nm in the presence of SDS was also observed. These results suggest that the SDS-induced PO activity of PpHc can be ascribed to conformational changes in the local environment of the typer-3 copper active site.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To report a rare case of a myoma simulating a pelvic tumor in a patient with Mayer-Rokitanski-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. The rudimentary uterus may develop fibroids, and this event can lead to problems in differential diagnosis, especially if no vaginal reconstruction has been carried out. DESIGN: Case-report. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): A 39-year-old patient with MRKH syndrome presented with a solid pelvic mass 9 cm in diameter on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging that could not be differentiated between fibroid and ovarian tumor. INTERVENTION(S): The patient was laparoscopically operated, and a fibroid of the right uterine residual was detected and removed. RESULT(S): Histology confirmed a benign leiomyoma. CONCLUSION(S): In patients with MRKH syndrome, laparoscopy allows analysis of the origin of a solid pelvic tumor and its removal. Especially in patients without vaginal reconstruction, laparoscopy may be superior to imaging techniques.<p>

The biosynthesis of linear and angular furanocoumarins is still poorly understood at the molecular level, with only psoralen synthase (CYP71AJ1) identified from Ammi majus. Using cDNA probes inferred from CYP71AJ1, three orthologs were isolated from Apium graveolens (CYP71AJ2) and Pastinaca sativa (CYP71AJ3 and -4) and functionally expressed in yeast cells. CYP71AJ2 and CYP71AJ3 displayed psoralen synthase activity, whereas CYP71AJ4 only catalyzed the conversion of (+)-columbianetin to angelicin and negligible amounts of a hydroxylated columbianetin by-product. CYP71AJ4 thus constitutes the first fully characterized P450 monooxygenase specific for the angular furanocoumarin pathway. The angelicin synthase exhibited an apparent K(m) of 2.1 +/- 0.4 microm for (+)-columbianetin and a k(cat) of 112 +/- 14 min(-1). Moreover, the use of 3'-deuterated (+)-columbianetin as substrate led to an almost complete &quot;metabolic switch,&quot; resulting in the synthesis of anti-3'-hydroxy-3'-deuterated(+)-columbianetin. This confirms that angelicin synthase attacks columbianetin by syn-elimination of hydrogen from C-3'. Sequence comparison between psoralen synthase (CYP71AJ3) and angelicin synthase (CYP71AJ4) showed 70% identity, whereas the identity dropped to 40% in those regions thought to provide the substrate recognition sites. Accordingly, CYP71AJ3 and CYP71AJ4 might be derived from a common ancestor of unknown functionality by gene duplication and subsequent molecular evolution.<p>

In vitro coronary artery responsiveness to noradrenaline, phenylephrine, and BHT-920 together with functional relaxation to acetylcholine was assessed in dogs at the early onset of pacing-induced heart failure (1 week) and in dogs recovered from heart failure (3 weeks paced, followed by 4 weeks discontinued pacing). alpha-Adrenoceptor stimulation produced contractile responses that were unaltered in early congestive heart failure and recovery. Contractions to noradrenaline and BHT-920 were always less than those produced by phenylephrine. Endothelium-intact arteries demonstrated relaxations in response to noradrenaline and BHT-920, but not phenylephrine. Relaxations to noradrenaline were enhanced 24% in early heart failure and 47% following recovery from heart failure, compared with control. BHT-920 produced relaxations that were augmented 21 and 76% in early heart failure and recovery, respectively. Contractile sensitivity to noradrenaline increased 5-fold in early heart failure and was not different in recovery, compared with control. Contractile sensitivity to BHT-920 and phenylephrine was unaltered throughout. Acetylcholine produced relaxations that were increased 21% in early heart failure and 13% after recovery from congestive heart failure. Furthermore, acetylcholine sensitivity was significantly enhanced in early heart failure and recovery.

The effect of the water-soluble fraction (WSF) of crude oil on lipid contents, lipid classes, FA, and PC molecular species was studied in high-phospholipid (hepatopancreas) and low-phospholipid (egg) tissues of a freshwater crustacean. After a 21-d exposure to a sublethal concentration of WSF, a significant decrease in shrimp total lipids was observed, although no alterations could be detected in the hepatopancreas or egg lipid contents. TAG/phospholipid ratios increased in the hepatopancreas and decreased in the eggs, suggesting alterations either in the mobilization of TAG to phospholipid pools or in the energy balance. The FA composition of phosphoglycerides in the hepatopancreas and eggs was dominated by PUFA, whereas the n-3/n-6 ratio was not affected by WSF exposure, although there was a significant increase in hepatopancreas 18:1n-9. Analysis of the PC molecular species by HPLC-ELSD showed the presence of 15 species, with 16:0/18:1, 18:1/18:2, 16:0/20:5, and 16:1/20:5 being the major species in the hepatopancreas. The PC molecular species in the eggs showed a different pattern, dominated by 16:0/18:1 and 18:1/18:2. Of the PC molecular species, 10 contained 22:6n-3, 20:5n-3, and 20:4n-6. Small amounts of di-PUFA species were also found. Exposure to WSF altered the PC molecular species in both tissues. The four major hepatopancreas molecular species and most of the ones containing PUFA decreased. This was compensated for by an increase in 16:1/18:1 (152%) and 18:1/18:1 (50%). The two major egg PC molecular species decreased, whereas the PUFA-containing ones increased. The contrasting responses of both tissues to WSF contamination suggests the presence of different homeostatic mechanisms.<p>

Borna disease (BD) is a naturally occurring enzootic encephalomyelitis of horses and sheep. The aetiological agent, Borna disease virus (BDV) is an unclassified, neurotropic, negative stranded RNA virus. The study aimed at providing further information on BD of naturally infected animals. Samples obtained from 20 animals (18 horses, 1 donkey, 1 sheep) were investigated by a series of virological and molecular biological tests. The highly sensitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was used to analyze the tissue distribution of BDV-specific RNA. BDV-specific RNA was detected in bulbus olfactorius, nucleus caudatus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex of all infected animals. BDV-RNA was also present in the spinal cord, eye, nasal mucosa, parotide gland, lung, heart, liver, kidney, bladder and ovaries. In addition, BV-specific RNA was also detected in conjunctival fluid, nasal secretions and saliva of two infected animals. By Western Blot assays the highest amounts of BDV antigens were demonstrated in bulbus olfactorius, nucleus caudatus, hippocampus and cerebral cortex.<p>

Purification and characterization of the female-specific protein (vitellogenin) from the hemolymph of mature female prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, were the objectives of this study. The comparison of biochemical characteristics between vitellogenin and ovarian vitellin was also conducted. Hemolymph vitellogenin was purified with DEAE, hydroxylapatite, and another DEAE chromatographic column. The specific protein (vitellogenin) was shown in the fractions of chromatographic columns on the basis of ELISA, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. A purified vitellogenin was obtained with an apparent molecular weight of 700 kDa as determined by PAGE. The purified vitellogenin was considered as a lipoglycoprotein on the basis of staining data. Three subunits (170, 100, and 89 kDa) in purified vitellogenin and two subunits (100 and 89 kDa) in vitellin were detected with SDS-PAGE. Nondisulfide bonds were found in the binding of polypeptide subunits. Only the 89-kDa subunit was a glycopolypeptide in both vitellogenin and vitellin. The amino acid composition of vitellogenin differed from that of vitellin in a few amino acids. Eight amino acid sequences from the N-terminal end of 89- and 100-kDa subunits were determined and they were identical between vitellogenin and vitellin. Seven amino acid sequence from the N-terminal end of the 170-kDa subunit were also identical to the 100-kDa subunit. Purified vitellogenin was more susceptible to precipitation in a solution with low ionic strength than vitellin. This study suggests a close relationship between vitellogenin and vitellin in M. rosenbergii in their biochemical characteristics.<p>

We have shown previously that treadmill exercise within lower body negative pressure (LBNPex) maintains upright exercise capacity (peak oxygen consumption, Vo(2peak)) in men after 5, 15, and 30 days of bed rest (BR). We hypothesized that LBNPex protects treadmill Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in women during a 30-day BR. Seven sets of female monozygous twins volunteered to participate. Within each twin set, one was randomly assigned to a control group (Con) and performed no countermeasures, and the other was assigned to an exercise group (Ex) and performed a 40-min interval (40-80% pre-BR Vo(2peak)) LBNPex (51 +/- 5 mmHg) protocol, plus 5 min of static LBNP, 6 days per week. Before and immediately after BR, subjects completed a 30.5-m sprint test and an upright graded treadmill test to volitional fatigue. These results in women were compared with previously reported reductions in Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in male twins after BR. In women, sprint speed (-8 +/- 2%) and Vo(2peak) (-6 +/- 2%) were not different after BR in the Ex group. In contrast, both sprint speed (-24 +/- 5%) and Vo(2peak) (-16 +/- 3%) were significantly less after BR in the Con group. The effect of BR on sprint speed and Vo(2peak) after BR was not different between women and men. We conclude that treadmill exercise within LBNP protects against BR-induced reductions in Vo(2peak) and sprint speed in women and should prove effective during long-duration spaceflight.<p>

An antibacterial peptide with 16 amino acid residues was found in plasma of the freshwater crayfish, Pacifastacus leniusculus. This peptide, designated astacidin 1, was purified by cation-exchange column chromatography and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Astacidin 1 has a broad range of antibacterial activity, and it inhibits growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The primary sequence of astacidin 1 was FKVQNQHGQVVKIFHH-COOH. The molecular mass was 1945.2 Da, and no carbohydrate-linked amino acid residues could be found by mass spectrometry. A synthetic astacidin 1 resulted in similar activity as the authentic astacidin 1 against Gram-positive bacteria, whereas it had less or no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Three amino-terminal-truncated synthetic peptides were made; they all showed low activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal part of astacidin 1 contributes to the antibacterial activity. The structure of astacidin 1 based on the CD results showed that it has a beta-sheet structure in citric acid buffer at pH 4, 6, and 8. Cloning of astacidin 1 shows that it is the carboxyl-terminal part of crayfish hemocyanin and that astacidin 1 is produced by a proteolytic cleavage from hemocyanin under acidic conditions. The processing and release of astacidin 1 from hemocyanin is enhanced when crayfish are injected with lipopolysaccharide or glucan.<p>

We investigated the possibility that stallion whinnies, known to encode caller size, also encoded information about caller arousal and fertility, and the reactions of mares in relation to type of voice. Voice acoustic features are correlated with arousal and reproduction success, the lower-pitched the stallion's voice, the slower his heart beat and the higher his fertility. Females from three study groups preferred playbacks of low-pitched voices. Hence, females are attracted by frequencies encoding for large male size, calmness and high fertility. More work is needed to explore the relative importance of morpho-physiological features. Assortative mating may be involved as large females preferred voices of larger stallions. Our study contributes to basic and applied ongoing research on mammal reproduction, and questions the mechanisms used by females to detect males' fertility.<p>

The objective of this study is to compare the clinical and radiographic results of ultraporous beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) versus autogenous iliac crest bone graft (ICBG), through prospective randomized pilot study (EBM-Level 1), as graft extenders in scoliosis surgery. In the posterior correction of scoliosis, local bone resected as part of the procedure is used as the base bone graft material. Supplemental grafting from the iliac crest is considered the gold-standard in posterior spinal fusion. However, autograft is not available in unlimited quantities, and bone harvesting is a source of significant morbidity. Ultraporous beta-TCP might be a substitute for ICBG in these patients and thus eliminate donor site morbidity. A total of 40 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) were randomized into two treatment groups and underwent corrective posterior instrumentation. In 20 patients, ICBG harvesting was performed whereas the other half received beta-TCP (VITOSS) to augment the local bone graft. If thoracoplasty was performed, the resected rib bone was added in both groups. Patients were observed clinically and radiographically for a minimum of 20 months postoperatively, with a mean follow-up of 4 years. Overall pain and pain specific to the back and donor site were assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). As a result, both groups were comparable with respect to the age at the time of surgery, gender ratio, preoperative deformity, and hence length of instrumentation. There was no significant difference in blood loss and operative time. In nine patients of the beta-TCP group and eight patients of the ICBG group, thoracoplasty was performed resulting in a rib graft of on average 7.9 g in both groups. Average curve correction was 61.7% in the beta-TCP group and 61.2% in the ICBG group at hospital discharge (P=0.313) and 57.2 and 54.3%, respectively, at follow-up (P=0.109). Loss of curve correction amounted on average 2.6 degrees in the beta-TCP group and 4.2 degrees in the comparison group (P=0.033). In the ICBG group, four patients still reported donor site pain of on average 2/10 on the VAS at last follow-up. One patient in the beta-TCP group was diagnosed with a pseudarthrosis at the caudal end of the instrumentation. Revision surgery demonstrated solid bone formation directly above the pseudarthrosis with no histological evidence of beta-TCP in the biopsy taken. In conclusion, the use of beta-TCP instead of ICBG as extenders of local bone graft yielded equivalent results in the posterior correction of AIS. The promising early results of this pilot study support that beta-TCP appears to be an effective bone substitute in scoliosis surgery avoiding harvesting of pelvic bone and the associated morbidity.<p>

Leroy, M., et al. (1996). &quot;Short-term variability of blood pressure during sleep in snorers with or without apnea.&quot; <u>Hypertension</u> <b>28</b>(6): 937-943.<p>
In normal subjects, the level and variability of blood pressure decrease during non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep. In contrast, sleep apnea is associated with large swings in nocturnal pressure. In this study, we evaluated a computer-derived index of all-night blood pressure variability in normotensive snorers with or without sleep apnea. We also examined this index in snorers receiving medical treatment for coexistent ischemic heart disease. Beat-to-beat blood pressure was recorded with a photoplethysmographic device (Finapres) throughout polysomnography. Subjects were categorized into four groups: those without cardiovascular disease without or with sleep apnea (&gt; or = 15 apnea plus hypopnea per hour of sleep), and those with ischemic heart disease without or with sleep apnea. A frequency distribution histogram of all increases and decreases of blood pressure according to their amplitudes was drawn and the SD of the distribution used as an estimation of variability. Mean systolic and diastolic pressures during the total sleep time were not different among the four groups. In contrast, the SD of the distribution of systolic and diastolic pressure variations that were higher in the apneic than in the nonapneic groups (P &lt; .05) correlated with apnea plus hypopnea (P &lt; .0001) and transient electroencephalographic arousal number per hour of sleep (P &lt; .0001). In both apneic and nonapneic subjects, blood pressure variability as assessed by SD decreased during stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep compared with stages 1 and 2 and REM sleep (P &lt; .001). Blood pressure variability was similarly increased in apneic subjects with or without ischemic heart disease. We speculate that in apneic individuals with coexistent ischemic heart disease, pressure variability that is increased despite treatment with beta-blockers or calcium antagonists may be a risk factor for acute coronary events.<p>

In this study, we have analyzed the changes of the ovarian nutritional resources in Dipetalogaster maxima at representative days of the reproductive cycle: previtellogenesis, vitellogenesis, as well as fasting-induced early and late atresia. As expected, the amounts of ovarian lipids, proteins, and glycogen increased significantly from previtellogenesis to vitellogenesis and then, diminished during atresia. However, lipids and protein stores found at the atretic stages were higher in comparison to those registered at previtellogenesis. Specific lipid staining of ovarian tissue sections evidenced remarkable changes in the shape, size, and distribution of lipid droplets throughout the reproductive cycle. The role of lipophorin (Lp) as a yolk protein precursor was analyzed by co-injecting Lp-OG (where OG is Oregon Green) and Lp-DiI (where DiI is 1,10-dioctadecyl-3,3,30,30-tetramethylindocarbocyanine) to follow the entire particle, demonstrating that both probes colocalized mainly in the yolk bodies of vitellogenic oocytes. Immunofluorescence assays also showed that Lp was associated to yolk bodies, supporting its endocytic pathway during vitellogenesis. The involvement of Lp in lipid delivery to oocytes was investigated in vivo by co-injecting fluorescent probes to follow the fate of the entire particle (Lp-DiI) and its lipid cargo (Lp-Bodipy-FA). Lp-DiI was readily incorporated by vitellogenic oocytes and no lipoprotein uptake was observed in terminal follicles of ovaries at atretic stages. Bodipy-FA was promptly transferred to vitellogenic oocytes and, to a much lesser extent, to previtellogenic follicles and to oocytes of ovarian tissue at atretic stages. Colocalization of Lp-DiI and Lp-Bodipy-FA inside yolk bodies indicated the relevance of Lp in the buildup of lipid and protein oocyte stores during vitellogenesis.<p>

L-Arginine kinase (AK; ATP:L-arginine N-phosphotransferase; EC 2.7.3.3) catalyzes the reversible transphosphorylation between N-phospho-L-arginine (PArg) and ATP thus buffering cellular ATP levels. AK was purified from the leg muscle of the locust Migratoria manilensis by Sephacryl S-200 HR gel filtration chromatography and DEAE Sepharose CL-6B fast flow anion exchange chromatography to an apparent homogeneity with a recovery of 80%. The enzyme behaved as monomeric protein with molecular mass of about 40 kD, and had a pH and temperature optimum of 8.6 and 30 degrees C, respectively, and a pI of about 6.3. The Michaelis constants for synthesis of PArg are 0.936 and 1.290 mM for L-arginine and ATP, respectively and k(cat)/K(m)(Arg) 174. The activity of AK required divalent cations such as Mg(2+) and Mn(2+). In the presence of Cu(2+) and Zn(2+), AK activity was greatly inhibited. The intrinsic protein fluorescence emission maximum at 330 nm using the excitation wavelength at 295 nm suggested that tryptophan residues are below the surface of the protein and not exposed to solvent.<p>

Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) regulate coagulation and inflammation. Heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, is an important cofactor for modulation of the inhibitory function of mammalian serpins. The secreted myxoma viral serpin, Serp-1 exerts profound anti-inflammatory activity in a wide range of animal models. Serp-1 anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic activity is dependent upon inhibition of the uPA / uPA receptor thrombolytic complex. We demonstrate here that heparin binds to Serp-1 and enhances Serp-1 inhibition of thrombin, a human pro-thrombotic serine protease, in vitro, altering inhibitory activity to a more predominant anti-thrombotic activity. Heparin also facilitates the simultaneous thrombin-mediated cleavage of Serp-1 and prevents formation of a serpin-typical SDS-resistant complex, implying mutual neutralization of Serp-1 and thrombin. In a cell-based assay, heparin facilitates Serp-1 reversal of cellular activation by stabilizing cellular membrane fluidity in thrombin-activated monocytes.

The 3-dimensional crystal structure of glutathione S-transferase (GST) of Schistosoma japonicum (Sj) fused with a conserved neutralizing epitope on gp41 (glycoprotein, 41 kDa) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Muster T et al., 1993, J Virol 67:6642-6647) was determined at 2.5 A resolution. The structure of the 3-3 isozyme rat GST of the mu gene class (Ji X, Zhang P, Armstrong RN, Gilliland GL, 1992, Biochemistry 31:10169-10184) was used as a molecular replacement model. The structure consists of a 4-stranded beta-sheet and 3 alpha-helices in domain 1 and 5 alpha-helices in domain 2. The space group of the Sj GST crystal is P4(3)2(1)2, with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 94.7 A, and c = 58.1 A. The crystal has 1 GST monomer per asymmetric unit, and 2 monomers that form an active dimer are related by crystallographic 2-fold symmetry. In the binding site, the ordered structure of reduced glutathione is observed. The gp41 peptide (Glu-Leu-Asp-Lys-Trp-Ala) fused to the C-terminus of Sj GST forms a loop stabilized by symmetry-related GSTs. The Sj GST structure is compared with previously determined GST structures of mammalian gene classes mu, alpha, and pi. Conserved amino acid residues among the 4 GSTs that are important for hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions for dimer association and glutathione binding are discussed.<p>

OBJECTIVE: This study reports the efficacy of a cognitive behavioral outpatient treatment on interpersonal outcome variables for patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. METHOD: In a 1-year clinical trial, 26 female patients with borderline personality disorder were randomly assigned to either dialectical behavior therapy or a treatment-as-usual comparison condition. All subjects met criteria of DSM-III-R and Diagnostic Interview for Borderline Patients for borderline personality disorder and were chronically suicidal. RESULTS: In both the intent-to-treat and treatment completion groups, dialectical behavior therapy subjects had significantly better scores on measures of anger, interviewer-rated global social adjustment, and the Global Assessment Scale and tended to rate themselves better on overall social adjustment than treatment-as-usual subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dialectical behavior therapy is a promising psychosocial intervention for improving interpersonal functioning among severely dysfunctional patients with borderline personality disorder.<p>

Linzen, B., et al. (1985). &quot;The structure of arthropod hemocyanins.&quot; <u>Science</u> <b>229</b>(4713): 519-524.<p>
Hemocyanins are large multi-subunit copper proteins that transport oxygen in many arthropods and molluscs. Comparison of the amino acid sequence data for seven different subunits of arthropod hemocyanins from crustaceans and chelicerates shows many highly conserved residues and extensive regions of near identity. This correspondence can be matched closely with the three domain structure established by x-ray crystallography for spiny lobster hemocyanin. The degree of identity is particularly striking in the second domain of the subunit that contains the six histidines which ligate the two oxygen-binding copper atoms. The polypeptide architecture of spiny lobster hemocyanin appears to be the same in all arthropods. This structure must therefore be at least as old as the estimated time of divergence of crustaceans and chelicerates, about 540 to 600 million years ago.<p>

A novel double coating enteric system (comprising an inner layer of neutralised EUDRAGIT) L 30 D-55 and organic acid, and an outer layer of standard EUDRAGIT) L 30 D-55) was developed to provide fast dissolution in proximal small intestinal conditions. The mechanisms involved in the dissolution of the double coating were investigated and compared with a conventional single layer enteric coating and an hypromellose (HPMC) sub-coated enteric system. Rates of drug release from coated prednisolone pellets were established using USP II dissolution methods (0.1M HCl for 2h and subsequently pH 5.5 phosphate buffer) and the coating dissolution process was illustrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The distribution of sodium, as a representative ion, in the double-coating system during dissolution was determined using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). The double-coating system showed faster dissolution compared to the single coating and the HPMC sub-coated system in pH 5.5 buffer. The dissolution process of the double-coating was unusual; the inner coat dissolved before the outer coat and this accelerated the dissolution of the outer coat. During dissolution, sodium ions diffused from the inner coat to the outer coat. This migration of ions and the increased ionic strength and buffer capacity of the inner coat contribute to the rapid dissolution of the double-coating system.<p>

During Blattella germanica embryo development, the nutritive yolk protein vitellin is processed by a cysteine protease, which is activated proteolytically from a proprotease during acidification of yolk granules. A murine polyclonal antiserum was generated with the purified proprotease as the immunogen. The antiserum was made monospecific to proprotease by subtractive affinity chromatography using proprotease-free yolk proteins as ligand. The purified antibodies were employed to investigate the temporal and spatial expression of the proprotease during vitellogenesis and embryo development. Anti-proprotease-reactive peptides appeared in extracts of fat bodies and ovarian follicles of post-mating females, but not in fat bodies of males or the fat bodies or follicles of unmated females, suggesting that the proprotease is synthesized extraovarially. Use of the antibodies was extended to monitor the kinetics of proprotease disappearance during early embryo development.<p>

An aspartic proteinase precursor, herein named BYC (Boophilus Yolk pro-Cathepsin) was isolated from eggs of the hard tick, Boophilus microplus. As judged by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide slab gel (SDS-PAGE), purified BYC presented 2 bands of 54 and 49 kDa, bearing the same NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. By Western blot analysis, BYC was also found in the haemolymph, indicating an extraovarian site of synthesis. Several organs were incubated in culture medium with [35S]methionine, and only the gut and fat body showed synthesis of BYC polypeptides. Protein sequencing of both the NH2-terminal and an internal sequence obtained after cyanogen bromide (CNBr) cleavage of BYC revealed homology with several aspartic proteinase precursors. Incubation at pH 3.5 resulted in autoproteolysis of BYC, which produced the mature form of the enzyme, that displayed pepstatin-sensitive hydrolytic activity against haemoglobin. Western blot analysis using anti-BYC monoclonal antibodies showed proteolytic processing of BYC during embryogenesis and suggested activation of the enzyme during development. A role of BYC in degradation of vitellin, the major yolk protein of tick eggs, is discussed.<p>

We report the isolation of a novel antimicrobial peptide, acanthoscurrin, from the hemocytes of unchallenged tarantula spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. A combination of Edman degradation, mass spectrometry and cDNA cloning revealed the presence of two isoforms of acanthoscurrin, differing by two glycine residues. Both displayed cationic properties and a high percentage of glycine residues. However, acanthoscurrins have no structural similarities with already known glycine-rich antimicrobial peptides from animals and plants. As deduced from cDNA cloning and mass spectrometry, the amino acid sequence of acanthoscurrin begins with a putative signal peptide of 23 amino acids followed by the mature peptide, which is post-translationally modified by a C-terminal amidation. Acanthoscurrins are constitutively expressed in hemocytes and released to plasma following an immune challenge.<p>

This study investigates the effect of enzymatic modifications of the HDL(3) surface lipid composition on their physical properties. Human HDL(3) (d: 1.125-1.21 g/ml) was treated either by an exogenous phospholipase A(2) from Crotalus adamanteus or by a sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus in the presence of albumin for various periods of time in order to obtain several degrees of hydrolysis. Glycerophospholipid hydrolysis ranged from 13 to 81% and sphingomyelinase action led to a 31-92% sphingophospholipid degradation. Physical properties of the surface of HDL(3) were examined by two spectroscopic methods: fluorescence polarisation and electron spin resonance. Glycerophospholipolysis treatment of HDL(3) enhanced the fluorescence anisotropy values (6-18%) and both relaxation correlation time (30-100%) and degree of order. All these results indicated a more rigid environment, a decreased mobility and an increased order of the surface lipids. Conversely, treatment of the HDL(3) with sphingophospholipase induced a progressive fluidization: fluorescence polarisation and degree of order decreasing down to 10% and relaxation correlation time down to 35% compared to native HDL(3). Taken together, all these observations suggest the relative importance of the two major phospholipids to modulate the fluidity and order of the surface of HDL(3) and could account for several recent physiological observations.<p>

Exported proteases of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are potentially involved in pathogen-associated disorders leading to gastric inflammation and neoplasia. By comprehensive sequence screening of the H. pylori proteome for predicted secreted proteases, we retrieved several candidate genes. We detected caseinolytic activities of several such proteases, which are released independently from the H. pylori type IV secretion system encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (cagPAI). Among these, we found the predicted serine protease HtrA (Hp1019), which was previously identified in the bacterial secretome of H. pylori. Importantly, we further found that the H. pylori genes hp1018 and hp1019 represent a single gene likely coding for an exported protein. Here, we directly verified proteolytic activity of HtrA in vitro and identified the HtrA protease in zymograms by mass spectrometry. Overexpressed and purified HtrA exhibited pronounced proteolytic activity, which is inactivated after mutation of Ser205 to alanine in the predicted active center of HtrA. These data demonstrate that H. pylori secretes HtrA as an active protease, which might represent a novel candidate target for therapeutic intervention strategies.<p>

SUN-domain proteins form a novel and conserved family of inner nuclear membrane (INM) proteins, which establish physical connections between the nucleoplasm and the cytoskeleton. In the current study, we provide evidence that within the nuclear envelope (NE) Sun1 proteins form highly immobile oligomeric complexes in interphase cells. By performing inverse fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis, we demonstrate in vivo that both perinuclear and nucleoplasmic Sun1 segments are essential for maintenance of Sun1 immobility at the NE. Our data in particular underline the self-association properties of the C-terminal coiled-coil Sun1 segment, the ability of which to form dimers and tetramers is demonstrated. Furthermore, the Sun1 tertiary structure involves interchain disulfide bonds that might contribute to higher homo-oligomer formation, although the overall dynamics of the Sun1 C-terminus remains unaffected when the cysteins involved are mutated. While a major Sun1 pool colocalizes with nuclear pore complex proteins, a large fraction of the Sun1 protein assemblies colocalize with immunoreactive foci of Sun2, another SUN-domain paralogue at the NE. We demonstrate that the Sun1 coiled-coil domain permits these heterophilic associations with Sun2. Sun1 therefore provides a non-dynamic platform for the formation of different macromolecular assemblies at the INM. Our data support a model in which SUN-protein-containing multi-variate complexes may provide versatile outer nuclear membrane attachment sites for cytoskeletal filaments.<p>

The rates of [14C]cholesterol transfer from small unilamellar vesicles containing cholesterol dissolved in bilayers of different phospholipids have been determined to examine the influence of phospholipid-cholesterol interactions on the rate of cholesterol desorption from the lipid-water interface. The phospholipids included unsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PC's) (egg PC, dioleoyl-PC, and soybean PC), saturated PC (dimyristoyl-PC and dipalmitoyl-PC), and sphingomyelins (SM's) (egg SM, bovine brain SM, and N-palmitoyl-SM). At 37 degrees C, for vesicles containing 10 mol% cholesterol, the half-times for exchange are about 1, 13, and 80 h, respectively, for unsaturated PC, saturated PC, and SM. In order to probe how differences in molecular packing in the bilayers cause the rate constants for cholesterol desorption to be in the order unsaturated PC greater than saturated PC greater than SM, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and monolayer methods were used to evaluate the cholesterol physical state and interactions with phospholipid. The NMR relaxation parameters for [4-13C]cholesterol reveal no differences in molecular dynamics in the above bilayers. Surface pressure (pi)-molecular area isotherms for mixed monolayers of cholesterol and the above phospholipids reveal that SM lateral packing density is greater than that of the PC with the same acyl chain saturation and length (e.g., at pi = 5 mN/m, where both monolayers are in the same physical state, dipalmitoyl-PC and palmitoyl-SM occupy 87 and 81 A2/molecule, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

There is evidence in human populations that exposure to manganese (Mn), or Mn in combination with excessive noise exposure, results in hearing loss. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed expression of the metal transporters DMT1, ZIP8, and ZIP14 in control mouse ears. ZIP8 is known to have a high affinity (K(m) = 2.2 microM) for Mn transport, and ZIP8 protein was localized to the blood vessels of the ear by immunohistochemistry. We treated mice (strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J) with Mn (100 mg/kg MnCl(2), by subcutaneous injection, on three alternating days), and Mn was significantly elevated in the ears of the treated mice. Mn concentrations remained elevated over controls for at least 2 weeks after treatment. These studies demonstrate that metal transporters are present in the mouse ear and that Mn can accumulate in the ear following systemic exposure. Future studies should focus on whether Mn exposure is associated with hearing deficits.<p>

Perchlorates are strong oxidants widely employed in military and civilian energetic materials and recently have been scrutinized as persistent environmental pollutants. The perchlorate anion, ClO(4)(-), is a well-known and potent competitive inhibitor of iodide transport by the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) expressed in the basolateral membranes of thyroid follicular cells (thyrocytes). Iodide uptake by thyroid follicular cells is rapid and reproducible. The competitive radiotransporter assay in this study shows promise as a rapid and convenient method to assay for ClO(4)(-) in water samples at the nM level. This work describes the initial efforts to define the assay conditions that enhance NIS selectivity for ClO(4)(-). Experiments of 10 min co-incubation of ClO(4)(-) and (125)I(-) demonstrate a more significant effect on (125)I(-) transport, with a quantifiable ClO(4)(-) concentration range of 50 nM (5 ppb) to 2 microM (200 ppb), and IC(50) of 180 nM (18 ppb), nearly three-fold lower than previous reports. Since the IC(50) in our assay for other known competitor anions (SCN(-), ClO(3)(-), NO(3)(-)) remains unchanged from previous research, the increased sensitivity for ClO(4)(-) also produces a three-fold enhancement in selectivity. In addition to the possible applicability of the thyrocyte to the development of a cellular perchlorate biosensor, we propose that the high affinity of the NIS for ClO(4)(-) also creates the potential for exploiting this membrane protein as a selective, sensitive, and broadly applicable biomechanical mechanism for controlled movement and concentration of perchlorate.<p>

A new strictly anaerobic bacterium (strain BAL-1T) has been isolated from a reed bed at Ballarat Goldfields in Australia. The organism grew by reducing arsenate [As(V)] to arsenite [As(III)], using acetate as the electron donor and carbon source; acetate alone did not support growth. When BAL-1T was grown with arsenate as the terminal electron acceptor, acetate could be replaced by pyruvate, L- and D-lactate, succinate, malate, and fumarate but not by H2, formate, citrate, glutamate, other amino acids, sugars, or benzoate. When acetate was the electron donor, arsenate could be replaced by nitrate or nitrite but not by sulfate, thiosulfate, or iron oxide. Nitrate was reduced to ammonia via nitrite. The doubling time for growth on acetate (5 mM) plus arsenate (5 mM) or nitrate (5 mM) was 4 h. The G+C content of the DNA is 49 mol%. The 16S rRNA sequence data for the organism support the hypothesis that this organism is phylogenetically unique and at present is the first representative of a new deeply branching lineage of the Bacteria. This organism is described as Chrysiogenes arsenatis gen. nov., sp. nov.<p>

Divergent selection acting on several different traits that cause multidimensional shifts are supposed to promote speciation, but the outcome of this process is highly dependent on the balance between the strength of selection vs. gene flow. Here, we studied a pair of sister species of Lake Victoria cichlids at a location where they hybridize and tested the hypothesis that divergent selection acting on several traits can maintain phenotypic differentiation despite gene flow. To explore the possible role of selection we tested for correlations between phenotypes and environment and compared phenotypic divergence (P(ST)) with that based on neutral markers (F(ST)). We found indications for disruptive selection acting on male breeding colour and divergent selection acting on several morphological traits. By performing common garden experiments we also separated the environmental and heritable components of divergence and found evidence for phenotypic plasticity in some morphological traits contributing to species differences.<p>

BACKGROUND: This study examined a 1-year cross-sectional sample of Kentucky Medicaid claims for the use of streptococcal diagnostic tests for pediatric tonsillopharyngitis and the empiric use of antibiotics. METHODS: Subjects were individuals older than 3 and younger than 18 years old seen in an ambulatory setting for tonsillopharyngitis; 3478 individuals accounted for the 5067 separate outpatient and emergency room encounters for pediatric tonsillopharyngitis; 849 encounters coded as streptococcal sore throat were also examined. RESULTS: Diagnostic tests for group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis were performed in only 22% (n = 1130) of the tonsillopharyngitis encounters and 36% (n = 306) of the streptococcal sore throat encounters. Urban physicians were more likely than rural physicians to use a diagnostic test (P = 0.0001). Emergency room encounters and outpatient encounters were not significantly different in the likelihood of having a diagnostic test (P = 0.16). In encounters for tonsillopharyngitis antibiotics were prescribed in 72% of the total encounters and in 73% of the encounters without a diagnostic streptococcal test. In encounters for streptococcal sore throat, antibiotics were prescribed for 68% of the total encounters and 69% of the encounters without a diagnostic streptococcal test. CONCLUSIONS: Current practices in the Kentucky Medicaid program do not follow the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.<p>

The diet of organisms generally provides a sufficient supply of energy and building materials for healthy growth and development, but should also contain essential nutrients. Species differ in their exogenous requirements, but it is not clear why some species are able to synthesize essential nutrients, while others are not. The unsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6) plays an important role in functions such as cell physiology, immunity, and reproduction, and is an essential nutrient in diverse organisms. LA is readily synthesized in bacteria, protozoa and plants, but it was long thought that all animals lacked the ability to synthesize LA de novo and thus required a dietary source of this fatty acid. Over the years, however, an increasing number of studies have shown active LA synthesis in animals, including insects, nematodes and pulmonates. Despite continued interest in LA metabolism, it has remained unclear why some organisms can synthesize LA while others cannot. Here, we review the mechanisms by which LA is synthesized and which biological functions LA supports in different organisms to answer the question why LA synthesis was lost and repeatedly gained during the evolution of distinct invertebrate groups. We propose several hypotheses and compile data from the available literature to identify which factors promote LA synthesis within a phylogenetic framework. We have not found a clear link between our proposed hypotheses and LA synthesis; therefore we suggest that LA synthesis may be facilitated through bifunctionality of desaturase enzymes or evolved through a combination of different selective pressures.<p>

The aim of the study was to examine whether apoptosis, apoptosis-related protein p53 and heat-shock protein (HSP) 72 participate in the response of the brain to focal injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received intravenously a photosensitive dye rose bengal. Unilateral cortical thrombosis was induced by illuminating the skull of rose bengal-treated rats for 10 min with a focused beam of light. Animals were killed and brains were processed for immunohistochemical detection of DNA fragmentation, p53, and HSP72 kD. DNA fragmentation and p53 were increased only in the perifocal area in the cortex ipsilateral to the thrombotic focus, while HSP72 increased throughout the ipsilateral cortex, except in the immediate perifocal area. The results suggest that in response to focal brain injury, some cells die through an apoptotic process that might involve an accumulation of p53.<p>

Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) in vitro inhibits both bone resorption and bone formation, resulting in a net decrease in bone turnover. In vivo administration of cyclosporin A (CsA) produces accelerated bone remodeling with resultant bone loss. The aim of this study was to investigate whether administration of IFN gamma to rats would favorably modify the high turnover osteopenia caused by CsA. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into 4 equal groups to receive either CsA (15 mg/kg.day) or vehicle by gavage and IFN gamma (10(6) IU/kg.day) or vehicle by ip injection for 8 days. Group 1 received CsA vehicle plus IFN gamma vehicle; group 2 received CsA plus IFN gamma vehicle; group 3 received CsA vehicle plus IFN-gamma; group 4 received CsA plus IFN gamma. Blood was sampled on days 0, 4, and 8 for measurement of ionized calcium (Ca2+), PTH, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and bone gla protein. Tibiae were removed on day 8 after double tetracycline labeling for histomorphometric analysis. Ca2+ and PTH levels were similar in all groups during the study period. Rats receiving CsA (groups 2 and 4) had elevated levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and bone gla protein, whereas rats receiving IFN gamma alone (group 3) had no change in levels of these parameters. Bone histomorphometry revealed that treatment with CsA and/or IFN gamma (groups 2-4) caused an increase in bone resorption surface and a decrease in some parameters of bone formation, resulting in a net loss of bone volume. Thus, IFN gamma failed to influence the osteopenia caused by CsA and on its own had adverse effects on bone in vivo. These results demonstrate that immune-mediating agents have opposing actions in vitro as compared to in vivo.<p>

Variations of protein concentrations in the haemolymph, hepatopancreas and ovaries were studied during the ovarian maturation of the shrimp Penaeus schmitti. The main variations observed during this physiological process are the increase of protein and the decrease of water contents in the ovary, more pronounced at the first stages of gonadosomatic index (GSI:0-4). During ovarian maturation, water content of the ovaries and hepatopancreas decrease from 10.7 and 3.9% respectively. In relative values, protein content increases from about 40.0% in the ovary, 47.5% in the haemolymph and 15.4% in the hepatopancreas. In absolute values, the protein concentrations of the hepatopancreas showed no significant variation. In the opposite, ovary protein content is 14.7 fold higher at the end than the early stages of vitellogenesis. Relations between haemolymph, hepatopancreas and ovary with eventual transfers of protein material are discussed.<p>

AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between IgG index values and the number of the oligoclonal IgG bands (OCB) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The set of 150 patients consisted of 41 males and 109 females (aged 18-68, mean 36.6 +/- 10.1 years). The CSF collected by a lumbar puncture was examined evaluating intrathecal synthesis using the IgG index and determining OCB. The number of alkaline OCB in the CSF was assessed using the method of isoelectric focusing. Pearson's correlation analysis, and homogeneity chi(2) test, Mann-Whitney test, paired-sample t-test (parametric) and Wilcoxon signed-ranks test (nonparametric) were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the results. RESULTS: No positive correlation between the IgG index and the number of OCB was found. Mann-Whitney test also failed to demonstrate any significant difference of the IgG index values in patients both with the OCB number &gt; or = 2 and &lt; 2. CONCLUSION: This study did not confirm any correlation between the IgG index values and the OCB number in the CSF of MS patients.<p>

In the present study, the effects of an increased daily dose of a dietary supplement (ATP-E, 0.2 g.kg-1.day-1) on Wingate test performance were examined in 12 men (21 +/- 1.6 years) prior to and following 14 days of supplement and placebo ingestion. A double-blind and counterbalanced design was used. Results revealed higher (p &lt; .007) preexercise blood ATP (95.4 +/- 10.5 mumol.dl-1) for the entire group following 14 days of ATP-E ingestion compared to placebo measures (87.6 +/- 10.9 mumol.dl-1). Mean power (667 +/- 73 W) was higher (p &lt; .008) after 14 days of ATP-E ingestion versus placebo (619 +/- 67 W). Peak plasma lactate was lower (p &lt; .07) after 14 days of ATP-E ingestion (14.9 +/- 2.8 mmol.L-1) compared to placebo (16.3 +/- 1.6 mmol.L-1). These data suggested that the improvement in 30-s Wingate test performance in this group may be related to the increased dose of ATP-E.<p>

Development and aging processes in mammals are associated with changes in several physiological parameters. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in erythrocyte lipid composition during sheep development. In all the age groups studied, cholesterol/phospholipid ratios remained constant, at close to unity, while phospholipid patterns (sphingomyelin: 45-51%, phosphatidylethanolamine: 26-33%, phosphatidylserine: 13-19% and phosphatidylcholine: less than 2%) changed during development, with a statistically significant decrease (P less than 0.01) in phosphatidylserine and an increase in sphingomyelin content. These data suggest an increase in the rigidity of the erythrocyte lipid bilayer in adult sheep when compared with 1-month-old animals due to a decrease in the phosphatidylserine/sphingomyelin ratio. Fatty acid profiles consistently showed 5 main acids: oleic (52-54%), stearic (17-18%), linoleic (9-15%), palmitic (8.5-11%) and arachidonic acid (2-3%), mainly with significant variations (P less than 0.01) in palmitic and linoleic acid contents, respectively reaching the highest and lowest percentages in the youngest sheep. However, the developmental process seems to have no influence on the aminophospholipid topology of erythrocytes. This study suggests that the animals' developmental process has a marked effect on the lipid composition of erythrocyte membranes, which could affect cell functions.<p>

Mark, H. F., et al. (1994). &quot;A practical cytogenetic protocol for in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity testing.&quot; <u>Annals of Clinical and Laboratory Science</u> <b>24</b>(5): 387-395.<p>
In vitro cytogenetics has been established as a valid method for evaluating the genotoxic potential of chemical agents. Armstrong et al have described a simple, quantitative approach to in vitro cytotoxicity and genotoxicity testing by using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. This approach can also be sensitive and repeatable in an inter-laboratory setting, a prerequisite for routine testing of compounds suspected of having genotoxic properties. In the present study, cytotoxicity was evaluated by the parameter of mitotic index (MI). Genotoxicity is measured by the chromosome aberration (Abs) assay as described by Armstrong et al using CHO cells. The basic analytic principles proposed were extended to include human lymphocytes. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis was used to establish an additional endpoint. Mitomycin C (MMC), an established clastogen, was used as the model compound for protocol validation. Dose response curves for MI and Abs in CHO cells were found to be consistent with those reported by Armstrong et al. Results from our extended study on lymphocytes and using SCE analysis were analogous. Our experience is that this standardized approach is indeed sensitive and reliable and can serve as a basis for an inter-laboratory testing program.<p>

The haemolymph of the tarantulas, Dugesiella (Eurypelma) californica and Dugesiella (Eurypelma) helluo contains high molecular weight haemocyanin (80-82% of total blood proteins) and a second protein not related to haemocyanin (18-20%). In the Lycosid spider, Cupiennius salei, haemocyanin (75% of total blood protein) occurs in two states of association. The haemocyanins were isolated by ultracentrifugation, gel filtration, isoelectric focusing, or preparative gel electrophoresis. Their sedimentation constants are 36.7 S (both tarantulas), 23.4 S and 15.9 S (Cupiennius). After alkaline dissociation, polypeptides sedimenting at 5.8 S (D. californica) and 4.7 S (Cupiennius) were obtained. The molecular weight of the intact functional subunit is (by sedimentation equilibrium) 70 300 (D. californica) and 69 900 (Cupiennius). Copper analysis results in closely similar values. By sodium dodecylsulphate gel electrophoresis, molecular weights of 71 000 (D. californica), 72 000 (Cupiennius) and 74 000 (D. helluo) were obtained. Denaturation with various agents did not lead to smaller polypeptides. The amino acid composition of the haemocyanins was determined (Table 1). The amino end group is blocked. The haemocyanins contain 1.2-1.5% of neutral carbohydrates and 0.3-0.5% of glucosamine (possibly acetylated). The neutral carbohydrates were identified with glucose, mannose, fucose, and arabinose, glucose being the dominant species. Neuraminic acid was not detected. The haemocyanins of the three species cannot be distinguished by their carbohydrate moieties, while there is a significant difference in amino acid composition between tarantula and Cupiennius haemocyanins. The second, non-respiratory protein isolated from spider blood sediments with 16.1 S (Dugesiella) or 15.9 S (Cupiennius). Its isoelectric point is at pH 5.5 It is stable in weakly alkaline solutions but can be denatured to yield polypeptide chains with molecular weights of 95 000 and 110 000. The amino acid composition is reported. As in the haemocyanins, the N-terminus is blocked. The carbohydrate content is 0.9%, glucose being the only sugar identified.<p>

Assimilatory sulfite reductase contains a sirohaem that is very weakly coupled to a [4Fe-4S] cubane, i.e. five iron atoms in total. Dissimilatory sulfite reductase is a complex system with 20 Fe atoms/alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 hexamer. A recent revision of the purification procedure for the Desulfovibrio vulgaris dissimilatory enzyme has afforded a preparation of only 10 Fe atoms hexamer, this has led to the convulsion that the topology of prosthetic groups parallels that of the assimilatory system [Wolfe, B. M., Lui, S. M. &amp; Cowan, J. A. (1994) Eur. J. Biochem. 223, 79-89]. The new purification procedure has been reproduced but the claimed molecular properties are not reproducible. The highly purified, active desulfoviridin contains 20, not 10, Fe atoms/molecule: the sirohaem is extensively dematallated, not metallated; and the S = 9/2 iron-sulfur cluster is present, not absent.<p>

Most animals store energy as long-chain triacylglycerols (lcTAGs). Trace amounts of acetylated triacylglycerols (acTAGs) have been reported in animals, but are not accumulated, likely because they have lower energy density than lcTAGs. Here we report that acTAGs comprise 36% of the neutral lipid pool of overwintering prepupae of the goldenrod gall fly, Eurosta solidaginis, while only 17% of the neutral lipid pool is made up of typical lcTAGs. These high concentrations of acTAGs, present only during winter, appear to be synthesized by E. solidaginis and are not found in other freeze-tolerant insects, nor in the plant host. The mixture of acTAGs found in E. solidaginis has a significantly lower melting point than equivalent lcTAGs, and thus remains liquid at temperatures at which E. solidaginis is frozen in the field, and depresses the melting point of aqueous solutions in a manner unusual for neutral lipids. We note that accumulation of acTAGs coincides with preparation for overwintering and the seasonal acquisition of freeze tolerance. This is the first observation of accumulation of acTAGs by an animal, and the first evidence of dynamic interconversion between acTAGs and lcTAGs during development and in response to stress.<p>

The blue copper protein hemocyanin from the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus is among the largest respiratory proteins found in nature (3.5 MDa) and exhibits a highly cooperative oxygen binding. Its 48 subunits are arranged as eight hexamers (1x6mers) that form the native 8x6mer in a nested hierarchy of 2x6mers and 4x6mers. This quaternary structure is established by eight subunit types (termed I, IIA, II, IIIA, IIIB, IV, V, and VI), of which only type II has been sequenced. Crystal structures of the 1x6mer are available, but for the 8x6mer only a 40 A 3D reconstruction exists. Consequently, the structural parameters of the 8x6mer are not firmly established, and the molecular interfaces between the eight hexamers are still to be defined. This, however, is crucial for understanding how allosteric transitions are mediated between the different levels of hierarchy. Here, we show the 10 A structure (FSC(1/2-bit) criterion) of the oxygenated 8x6mer from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and single-particle analysis. Moreover, we show its molecular model as obtained by DNA sequencing of subunits II, IIIA, IV and VI, and molecular modelling and rigid-body fitting of all subunit types. Remarkably, the latter enabled us to improve the resolution of the cryo-EM structure from 11 A to the final 10 A. The 10 A structure allows firm assessment of various structural parameters of the 8x6mer, the 4x6mer and the 2x6mer, and reveals a total of 46 inter-hexamer bridges. These group as 11 types of interface: four at the 2x6mer level (II-II, II-IV, V-VI, IV-VI), three form the 4x6mer (V-V, V-VI, VI-IIIB/IV/V), and four are required to assemble the 8x6mer (IIIA-IIIA, IIIA-IIIB, II-IV, IV-IV). The molecular model shows the amino acid residues involved, and reveals that several of the interfaces are intriguingly histidine-rich and likely to transfer allosteric signals between the different levels of the nested hierarchy.<p>

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Worldwide the quality of care of patients with type 2 diabetes has been investigated only by analysing within cross-sectional studies. But the quality of care in relation to statutory or private health plans in not known. It was the aim of this study to ascertain retrospectively, how in the course of time from first diagnosis the quality of medical care of patients with type 2 diabetes differed depending on the type of health insurance of the individual patient. METHODS AND PATIENTS: As part of the ROSSO study (a German retrospective epidemiological cohort study), data on all patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between 1.1.1995 and 31.12.1999 had been recorded. They had been collected from 192 randomly selected general practitioner or internal medicine specialist practices. RESULTS: The data of 3268 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were recorded. The mean observation period was 6.5 years. The mean age of this patients at the time of diagnosis of diabetes was 62.4 +/- 9.6 years, 49 % being male. The portion of patients visiting their chosen practice at least 3 - 4 times in a given year was about 70 - 80 %. Documentation of HbA (1c) or blood pressure as requested in the guideline was presented in 20 - 50 % of patient files with no differences between enrolled in a statutory or private health plans. Even when cholesterol or blood pressure levels were greatly elevated 20 - 50 % of patients had been prescribed no adequate drug treatment. Only 20 % of the patients had been described platelet aggregation inhibitors during the first years after myocardial infarction or stroke. CONCLUSION: The quality of care in general practitioner of specialist internal medicine practices failed to meet the guidelines for patients with type 2 diabetes. There were no differences that depended on whether the patients had been enrolled in a statutory or private health plan.<p>

BACKGROUND: Bax is one of the main effectors of apoptosis in breast cancer. However, in contrast with the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, which has been extensively studied in this tumor, there are relatively few clinical studies on the biological role of Bax in breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of the apoptosis-related Bax gene was studied in a series of 255 previously untreated breast cancers by means of immuno-flow cytometry. Additionally, and by the same method, the expression of the Bcl-2, VEGF and Nup88 genes were also studied. As variables of the study for the final statistical analysis, the histological variety of the tumors, histological and nuclear grade, the expression of hormone receptors, p53, Ki-67 or c-erb-B2, axillary node invasion, tumor size and DNA-ploidy were also included. RESULTS: The expression of the proapoptotic Bax protein was significantly associated with the expression of Nup88 (p&lt;0.0001), VEGF (p=0.0014) and Bcl-2 (p=0.0063), all measured by the same method. An inverse correlation with c-erb-B2 expression, which almost attained statistical significance (p=0.058) was also registered. CONCLUSION: This study adds evidence to the little explored link between apoptosis and angiogenesis. Furthermore, it discloses a previously unreported relationship between Bax and Nup88 expression.<p>

The mitochondrial FOF1 ATP synthase produces ATP in a reaction coupled to an electrochemical proton gradient generated by the electron transfer chain. The enzyme also hydrolyzes ATP according to the energy requirements of the organism. Shrimp need to overcome low oxygen concentrations in water and other energetic stressors, which in turn lead to mitochondrial responses. The aim of this study was to characterize the full-length cDNA sequences of three subunits that form the central stalk of the F1 catalytic domain of the ATP synthase of the white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei and their deduced proteins. The effect of hypoxia on shrimp was also evaluated by measuring changes in the mRNA amounts of these subunits. The cDNA sequences of the nucleus-encoded ATPgamma, ATPdelta and ATPepsilon subunits are 1382, 477 and 277 bp long, respectively. The three deduced amino acid sequences exhibited highly conserved regions when compared to homologous sequences, and specific substitutions found in shrimp subunits are discussed through an homology structural model of F1 ATP-synthase that included the five deduced proteins, which confirm their functional structures and specific characteristics from the cognate complex of ATP synthases. Genes expression was evaluated during hypoxia-reoxygenation, and resulted in a generalized down-regulation of the F1 subunits and no coordinated changes were detected among these five subunits. The reduced mRNA levels suggest a mitochondrial response to an oxidative stress event, similar to that observed at ischemia-reperfusion in mammals. This model analysis and responses to hypoxia-reoxygenation may help to better understand additional mitochondrial adaptive mechanisms.<p>

PURPOSE: The plasminogen/plasmin system is an important extracellular protease system whose function has been implicated in male reproductive function. However, its clinical relevance to fertility in human assisted reproduction technologies has not been systematically investigated. Here, we examined whether total and active populations of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) in human seminal plasma and spermatozoa are predictive of pregnancy outcome in couples undergoing insemination or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). METHODS: Seminal samples from 182 men, 5 donors, 21 patients attending the clinic for infertility screening, and 156 for assisted reproduction technology (ART) treatment (insemination and ICSI), were evaluated. Total uPA in seminal plasma and spermatozoa as well as active uPA in seminal plasma were measured by ELISA. Sperm quality parameters and fertility outcomes following insemination or ICSI were correlated with the uPA values. RESULTS: Active uPA in seminal plasma was positively correlated to the volume of the ejaculate, total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate, and total motility. However, these values were not prognostic of fertility outcomes. Total uPA in spermatozoa was inversely related to sperm concentration, total sperm in ejaculate, morphology, and total and progressive motility, and this measure was not related to fertility. Importantly, however, higher values of total uPA in seminal plasma were detected in cases that resulted in pregnancy compared to those that did not follow insemination and ICSI treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings lay the foundation for further understanding the mechanism by which total uPA in seminal plasma affects fertility and how this marker can be used as a predictor of ART outcomes.<p>

The distribution of cholinergic interneurons with respect to enkephalin-rich patches in the caudate nucleus of the cat was examined using both computer-assisted 3-D reconstruction and immunocytochemical techniques. Examination of the 3-D distribution of perikarya staining for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) revealed that these cells were not evenly distributed within the caudate nucleus but exhibited areas of increased and decreased density. Comparison of the 3-D distribution of cholinergic perikarya to that of the enkephalin-rich patches indicated that areas of increased ChAT+ cell density often corresponded to the positions of enkephalin-rich patches within the dorsal-lateral caudate nucleus. At more ventral regions, there was no clear correspondence between areas of increased ChAT+ cell density and enkephalin-rich patches. In agreement with these observations, a quantitative analysis of sections double-labeled for ChAT and enkephalin revealed that the density of cholinergic neurons within enkephalin-rich patches was twice that in the surrounding tissue in the dorsal region of the caudate nucleus. In contrast at more ventral levels, the difference in the density of ChAT+ cells in enkephalin-rich patches did not significantly differ from that in the surrounding striatal tissue. Both the results of the 3-D and the double-labeling analysis suggest that cholinergic neurons are not evenly distributed within the caudate nucleus of the cat but form loose clusters which are associated dorsally with the enkephalin-rich patches. These results also provide further evidence of heterogeneity within the striosomal compartment in the cat.<p>

Atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased significantly over the last century and continuing increases are expected to have significant effects on current ecosystems. This study evaluated the behavioural and physiological (hormone status, muscle structure) effects of prolonged CO2 exposure in young female Wistar rats exposed at 700ppm of CO2 during 6h a day for 15days. Prolonged CO2 exposure, though not continuous, produced significant disturbances in behaviour with an increase in drinking, grooming and resting, and a reduction in rearing, jumping-play and locomotor activity. Furthermore, CO2 exposure was accompanied by increased plasma levels of corticosterone, suggesting that prolonged exposure to CO2 was stressful. The muscular structure can also be modified also when respiratory working conditions change. The expression of myosin heavy chain was significantly affected in the diaphragm and oral respiratory muscles: Masseter Superficialis and Anterior Digastric. Modified behaviour and hormonal changes both appear to be at the origin of the observed muscular adaptation.<p>

In this study, we have examined the relative contributions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in controlling an acute or chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. To study acute infection, we used the LCMV Armstrong strain, which is cleared by adult mice in 8 to 10 days, and to analyze chronic infection, we used a panel of lymphocyte-tropic and macrophage-tropic variants of LCMV that persist in adult mice for several months. We show that CD4+ T cells are not necessary for resolving an acute LCMV infection. CD4+ T-cell-depleted mice were capable of generating an LCMV-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response and eliminated virus with kinetics similar to those for control mice. The CD8+ CTL response was critical for resolving this infection, since beta 2-microglobulin knockout (CD8-deficient) mice were unable to control the LCMV Armstrong infection and became persistently infected. In striking contrast to the acute infection, even a transient depletion of CD4+ T cells profoundly affected the outcome of infection with the macrophage- and lymphocyte-tropic LCMV variants. Adult mice given a single injection of anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (GK1.5) at the time of virus challenge became lifelong carriers with high levels of virus in most tissues. Unmanipulated adult mice infected with the different LCMV variants contained virus for prolonged periods (&gt; 3 months) but eventually eliminated infection from most tissues, and all of these mice had LCMV-specific CD8+ CTL responses. Although the level of CTL activity was quite low, it was consistently present in all of the chronically infected mice that eventually resolved the infection. These results clearly show that even in the presence of an overwhelming viral infection of the immune system, CD8+ CTL can remain active for long periods and eventually resolve and/or keep the virus infection in check. In contrast, LCMV-specific CTL responses were completely lost in chronically infected CD4-depleted mice. Taken together, these results show that CD4+ T cells are dispensable for short-term acute infection in which CD8+ CTL activity does not need to be sustained for more than 2 weeks. However, under conditions of chronic infection, in which CD8+ CTLs take several months or longer to clear the infection, CD4+ T-cell function is critical. Thus, CD4+ T cells play an important role in sustaining virus-specific CD8+ CTL during chronic LCMV infection. These findings have implications for chronic viral infections in general and may provide a possible explanation for the loss of human immunodeficiency virus-specific CD8+ CTL activity that is seen during the late stages of AIDS, when CD4+ T cells become limiting.<p>

Calcium metabolism was studied in 47 patients with borderline or lepromatous leprosy. Total and ionized calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, total alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D], and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] were measured in serum; calcium and total hydroxyproline were determined in urine. Total subperiosteal diameter and medullar cavity diameter were measured on an X-ray of the hand of all patients. Average values were within normal ranges for all of the biochemical determinations. Total serum calcium was moderately below the normal range in eight patients but ionized calcium levels were within the normal ranges in all of the patients. Four patients, all of them with lepromatous leprosy, had levels of 1,25(OH)2D higher than normal but none of them was hypercalcemic and PTH levels were within normal range. Although all values were within the normal ranges, lepromatous leprosy patients had lower total calcium, higher alkaline phosphatase, and higher urinary hydroxyproline than borderline leprosy patients (9.1 +/- 0.4 vs 9.4 +/- 0.3 mg%, p &lt; 0.001; 10.3 +/- 2.9 vs 7.4 +/- 2.3 King-Armstrong units, p &lt; 0.02 and 27.2 +/- 12 vs 19.4 +/- 5.6 mg/24 hr, p &lt; 0.02, respectively). No differences were found between patients and controls in the average micrometric measurements of the second metacarpal bone but significant osteopenia was found in 19% of the patients. The main finding of the present study in a representative sample of leprosy patients is that the average total serum calcium was in the lowest limit of the normal range, but the ionized serum calcium was in the middle of the normal range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

Using murine myeloid factor-dependent FDC-P1/ER cells, we demonstrate that the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin-3 and erythropoietin and bryostatin-1, a macrocyclic lactone natural product and potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), suppress apoptosis and induce the rapid serine phosphorylation of Bc12 alpha. Expression of recombinant wild type Bc12 alpha in NFS/N1.H-7 cells confirms that murine Bc12 alpha is phosphorylated following PKC activation. The PKC inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine, but not the protein kinase A inhibitor HA1004, block not only interleukin-3- and bryostatin-1-induced hyperphosphorylation of Bc12 alpha but also their anti-apoptotic effect on growth factor-dependent cells, suggesting a role for activated PKC in both processes. A potential direct role for a classic isoform of PKC is indicated by the Ca(2+)-dependent nature of phosphorylation of Bc12 alpha mediated by purified PKC in vitro. Comparative phosphopeptide maps confirm that Bc12 alpha phosphorylation occurs on identical serine site(s) whether phosphorylation occurs in cells following agonist treatment or directly by PKC in vitro. These findings strongly support a role for activated PKC in growth factor-induced Bc12 alpha phosphorylation as well as suppression of apoptosis.<p>

Software which provides an interface to the features of the Sound Blaster Pro card for the IBM PC using MS-DOS is described. The library may be called from a Turbo Pascal version 6 program. It permits tones of specified frequency (500 Hz-8 kHz in increments of 500Hz) and aversive noise to be turned on and off by a controlling program, during cognitive event-related potential paradigms. Tones are synthesized by hardware and noise is replayed from memory using the digital sound processor. The library provides the appropriate level of abstraction for the programmer designing such paradigms, by hiding the detail of the register level. It provides a model for programming the card in other high level languages and may be augmented to provide more complex stimuli, such as short segments of speech or music. The card when controlled by the library provides a versatile and cost effective alternative to an audiometer in the electrophysiological laboratory.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To compare the appropriateness of coronary angiography and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) use between the United States and Canada. DESIGN: Retrospective randomized medical record review. SETTING: All hospitals performing coronary angiography and/or CABG surgery in two Canadian provinces (Ontario and British Columbia); in New York State, 15 randomly selected hospitals that provide coronary angiography and 15 randomly selected hospitals that provide CABG surgery. PATIENTS: All patients were randomly selected. For coronary angiography, 533 patients in Canada and 1333 patients in New York were selected; for CABG, 556 patients in Canada and 1336 patients in New York were selected. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of patients in each country who had coronary angiography or CABG for necessary, appropriate, uncertain, or inappropriate indications as rated by criteria developed separately in each country and the complications of those procedures. RESULTS: For coronary angiography, 9% of Canadian cases and 10% of New York cases were rated inappropriate using Canadian criteria compared with 5% and 4%, respectively, using US criteria. For CABG, 4% of Canadian cases and 6% of New York cases were rated inappropriate by Canadian criteria compared with 3% and 2%, respectively, using US criteria. A lower proportion of procedures were performed on persons aged 75 years or older in Canada than in New York for both coronary angiography (5% vs 11%; P &lt; .001) and CABG (6% vs 14%; P &lt; .001). Women were also represented in lower proportions among angiography cases in Canada than in New York (28% vs 35%; P = .023). Canadian patients with left main coronary disease waited significantly longer between angiography and CABG than did New York patients (P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of inappropriate use of cardiac procedures were low in Canada and New York, which suggests that the regionalization of cardiac procedures that characterizes both health care systems contributes to better clinical decision making. Differences in the use of cardiac procedures among the elderly in the two countries merits further comparative examination.<p>

OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) if radiotherapy (RT) improves survival or neurologic function in elderly patients with malignant supratentorial glioma (MSG) and (2) which prognostic factors predict survival. BACKGROUND: The prevalence of MSG is increasing because both the number of elderly patients and the age-adjusted incidence are increasing. Because age is a powerful negative prognostic factor in MSG, it is not clear if RT is useful in the elderly. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively studied 103 patients from the Southern Alberta Cancer Registry diagnosed January 1, 1978, to December 31, 1993, aged 70 yrs, with MSG in whom sufficient clinical and follow-up information was available. Multiple treatment and patient factors were compared with survival and neurologic function score. Diagnosis was confirmed in 15 (14.6%) by biopsy, in 66 (64.1%) by resection, and in 22 (21.4%) by clinical course and typical radiographic appearance only. RESULTS: All patients died and median survival was 3.9 months. Better neurologic function at diagnosis and administration of RT were independently associated with significantly longer survivals (p = 0.001 and &lt; 0.001; log rank test). However, RT was only associated with longer survival in patients aged less than 80 years. Neurologic status only rarely improved following RT. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for elderly patients with MSG is poor. RT is unlikely to benefit patients who are aged 80 years or older.

The new technologies for next-generation sequencing (NGS) and global gene expression analyses that are widely used in molecular medicine are increasingly applied to the field of fish biology. This has facilitated new directions to address research areas that could not be previously considered due to the lack of molecular information for ecologically relevant species. Over the past decade, the cost of NGS has decreased significantly, making it possible to use non-model fish species to investigate emerging environmental issues. NGS technologies have permitted researchers to obtain large amounts of raw data in short periods of time. There have also been significant improvements in bioinformatics to assemble the sequences and annotate the genes, thus facilitating the management of these large datasets.The combination of DNA sequencing and bioinformatics has improved our abilities to design custom microarrays and study the genome and transcriptome of a wide variety of organisms. Despite the promising results obtained using these techniques in fish studies, NGS technologies are currently underused in ecotoxicogenomics and few studies have employed these methods. These issues should be addressed in order to exploit the full potential of NGS in ecotoxicological studies and expand our understanding of the biology of non-model organisms.<p>

Musicogenic epilepsy (ME) is a condition in which seizures are triggered by music. We describe a novel investigation of the mechanisms of ME using noninvasive (ictal 2-flurodeoxyglucose (2-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)) and invasive (subdural arrays and depth electrodes) methodology in one patient with ME. Ictal PET defined onsets in the right mesial temporal lobe. This was confirmed by intracranial electrode recordings, where there was onset in the right mesial temporal lobe, followed by sequential spread to the lateral temporal cortex, Heschel's gyrus, insula, and frontal lobes. Right temporal lobectomy resulted in Engel class 1 outcome.<p>

Oocyte maturation (meiosis reinitiation) in starfish is induced by the natural hormone 1-methyladenine. This induction of meiotic divisions can be triggered also by four fatty acids: 5,8,11-20:3; 5,8,11,14-20:4 (arachidonic acid); 6,9,12,15-20:4; 5,8,11,14,17-20:5, all other fatty acids being completely inactive. This maturation triggered by eicosanoids occurs in the micromolar range and is facilitated by the presence of calcium. A variety of arachidonic acid derivatives (esters, epoxides, etc.) and metabolites (cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products) has been tested; the biological activity is restricted to 8-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (8-HETE), other mono- and poly-HETEs being completely inactive. Maturation triggered by 8-HETE occurs around 10 nM and is insensitive to the presence of calcium. 8-HETE methyl ester and 8-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid are able to induce maturation at higher concentrations. Both (8S) and (8R) stereoisomers have been tested; the biological activity is strictly restricted to the (8R) isomer. 8-HETE triggers a complete maturation, i.e. maturation-promoting factor appearance, germinal vesicle breakdown, emission of the polar bodies, and formation of a female pronucleus. (8R)-HETE, but not (8S)-HETE, triggers the typical decrease in cyclic AMP concentration induced by 1-methyladenine and the burst of protein phosphorylation associated with maturation. Starfish oocytes oxidize exogenous arachidonic acid into 8-HETE and other HETEs. 8-HETE was identified, after high pressure liquid chromatography purification, by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Furthermore, it was found that the starfish oocytes only produce the (8R)-HETE isomer. This highly stereospecific induction of oocyte maturation by (8R)-HETE suggests that this fatty acid, or a very closely related fatty acid, may play a role in the transduction of the 1-methyladenine message at the plasma membrane level.<p>

The synthesis and secretion of vitellogenin by the ovary of Rhodnius prolixus was investigated. Using whole ovary or epithelial cells isolated from follicles of different sizes, it is shown that the follicle cells are a site of synthesis for this protein in the ovary. The ovaries or follicle cells were incubated in vitro with [(35)S]-methionine or (32)Pi and the secretion of newly synthesized ovarian vitellogenin (O-Vg) was estimated by the radioactivity associated with the immunoprecipitate or acid-precipitate proteins in the culture medium. The radioactive O-Vg was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or after elution from a DEAE-Toyopearl column. The presence of O-Vg inside the follicle cells was detected by immunofluorescence and immunogold labels. Both methods revealed strong labeling inside the follicle cells. While the capacity for total protein synthesis by the follicle cells was maximal during the early phase of vitellogenesis (in small follicles), the synthesis of O-Vg reached its peak during the late phase of oocyte growth, just before formation of the chorion. A possible role for ovarian vitellogenin in Rhodnius and its relationship with Vg synthesis by the fat body is discussed.<p>

BACKGROUND: Parenteral nutrition (PN) can be administered with separate bottles or as commercially prepared all-in-one systems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall cost of PN using the 3-compartment bag vs standard multibottle system. METHODS: Overall costs of hospital PN were calculated from expenditures (solutions, consumable items, and staff costs). Time that staff spent preparing the PN was measured to determine personnel costs; bottom-up costing was used to assign a monetary value. Standard treatment algorithms of a 10-day course of PN for a standard 70-kg patient were specified for both systems. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model's conclusions. RESULTS: The daily total cost of the 3-compartment bag system was euro42.26 per patient whereas the total cost of the separate bottle system was euro51.62, resulting in a cost saving of euro9.36 per patient with the 3-compartment bag system. For 10 days of treatment, PN costs euro422.51 per patient for the 3-compartment system vs euro516.16 for the multibottle system. Sensitivity analyses showed that the difference in costs between the 2 systems was maintained in the face of changes in patients' nutrition requirements and personnel costs. CONCLUSIONS: The costs associated with PN using a 3-compartment bag system were lower than those associated with a multibottle system. Given the established therapeutic equivalence of the 2 systems, this study shows the 3-compartment bag system to be the system of choice to reduce costs.<p>

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells constitute a subpopulation of T cells that recognize glycolipids presented by CD1d molecules. They are characterized by their prompt production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which enables them to modulate diverse immune responses. Recently, we enlarged this concept by identifying a distinct IL-17-producing iNKT cell subset, named iNKT17 cells. The mechanisms leading to the acquisition of this new iNKT cell activity are unknown. Herein we show that IL-17-producing iNKT cells are already present in the thymus, predominantly among a subset regarded so far as an immature stage of thymic iNKT cell development, the CD1d tetramer(pos)CD44(pos)NK1.1(neg)CD4(neg) cells. Using EGFP reporter mice, we demonstrate that the transcription factor ROR-gammat is critical for the thymic differentiation of this subset because only ROR-gammat(pos) iNKT cells are capable of massively secreting IL-17. Moreover, IL-17-producing CD1d tetramer(pos)CD44(pos)NK1.1(neg)CD4(neg) thymic iNKT cells have reached a mature differentiation stage because they fail to generate other cell subsets in fetal thymic organ culture. Conversely, thymic ROR-gammat(neg) iNKT cell precursors give rise to progeny, but acquire neither ROR-gammat expression nor the ability to secrete IL-17. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate an alternative thymic pathway leading to the development of iNKT17 cells that requires ROR-gammat expression.<p>

MCAT elements and its cognate binding partners, the transcription enhancer factors (TEFs) play important roles in the regulation of expression of several muscle-specific genes. The biological effects of TEFs strongly depend on different co-factors, which might act as co-activators or anti-repressors to enable transcriptional activation of target genes by TEFs. Previously, we have cloned and characterized VITO-1, which acts as a skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional co-activator of TEFs. Here we describe the cloning and expression profile of a related gene, VITO-2 (also termed Vgl-3), which shares a high homology with VITO-1 in the SID domain responsible for interaction with TEFs. During early embryonic and fetal development VITO-2 is mainly expressed in the myogenic lineage with an onset of expression in the myotomes of somites VI at E9.5 slightly later than VITO-1. At later developmental stages VITO-2 is predominantly found in the nervous system. In adult mice VITO-2 was detected in different tissues, including skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, liver and brain, where it was found in cortical and cerebellar neurons as well as in Purkinje cells. The expression of VITO-2 in the mesoderm was repressed by the notch/delta pathway and activated by Myf-5 since Dll-1 mutant showed an aberrant expression of VITO-2 but not VITO-1 in the tail bud and in the caudal neural tube at E10.5 while Myf-5 mutant mice lack expression of VITO-1 and VITO-2 in somites until E10.5.<p>

Variation in response to fescue toxicosis was examined in inbred and linecross mice. In Exp. 1, exposure to a 50% endophyte-infected tall fescue diet (E+) reduced ADG of males from six inbred lines, but ADG of males from one line was modestly higher on E+. Lines differed (P &lt; .01) for reproductive organ weight, but the diet x line interaction was not significant. In Exp. 2, an apparently susceptible (C57) and an apparently resistant line (FVB) were mated to produce inbred and linecross offspring. The reduction in weight gain caused by the E+ diet did not differ significantly among the genetic groups. In Exp. 3, C57 and C57 backcrosses had smaller reductions in ADG during E+ vs control feeding periods than FVB and FVB backcrosses (P &lt; .10). In Exp. 4, the E+ diet reduced litter size of mates of C57 males by one pup, whereas litter size of mates of FVB males was four pups larger (interaction P = .07). Neither diet, line, nor their interaction affected male reproductive organ weights or tissue proportions in testis cross-sections. In Exp. 5, the E+ diet did not affect weight gain of C57 or FVB males, but effects of the E+ diet on litter size of mates were similar to those in Exp. 4. Percentage of abnormal sperm was increased in C57 males on the E+ diet but decreased in FVB males (Exp. 5). Differences among inbred lines in susceptibility to fescue toxicosis may depend on severity of the challenge and life cycle stage when the challenge is imposed.<p>

On September 23, 1993, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published the final monograph and rule for topical antifungal drug products. This monograph specifies the ingredients, concentration, and labeling under which over-the-counter (OTC) topical antifungal drug products may be marketed without further FDA approval. Currently, the nine products tested are labeled as antifungal because of their ability to inhibit the growth of yeast (C. albicans) in vitro. Over-the-counter products containing 2% miconazole nitrate--an ingredient and concentration identified as safe and effective--were found to inhibit the growth of C. albicans as effectively as mycostatin cream. Two percent miconazole nitrate was also inhibitory to C. albicans at greater dilutions than five other antifungal products containing chloroxylenol and clotri mazole. Chloroxylenol and clotrimazole are nonmonographed ingredients.<p>

The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann), which is often controlled chemically, is a major citrus pest in Spain; however, alternative biological control strategies such as those based on the conservation of polyphagous predators should be developed. The wolf spider, Pardosa cribata Simon, is an abundant predator found in citrus orchards in eastern Spain. In this study, we have evaluated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques as a means of detecting C. capitata DNA remains in P. cribata specimens. To do so, two pairs of C. capitata species-specific primers were designed and tested. Primer specificity was tested on species closely related to C. capitata and with other pests and natural enemies present in citrus orchards. Medfly DNA was detectable in 100% of P. cribata from 0 to 12 h post ingestion for both primer pairs, decreasing to 37% at 96 h after prey ingestion for one pair of primers. DNA detectability half-lives were of 78.25 h and 78.08 h for each pair of primers but no statistical differences were found between them. Pardosa cribata specimens were field-collected daily after sterile C. capitata pupae had been deployed in the citrus orchard. Afterwards, the wolf spiders were analyzed and DNA remains of C. capitata were detected in 5% of them, with a peak of 15% coinciding with maximum C. capitata emergence. This study is the first to reveal the potential use of DNA markers to track medfly predation by P. cribata in citrus orchards and provides a new tool to estimate the potential role of this spider in biological-control conservation programs.<p>

BACKGROUND: Tactile defensiveness in children is associated with difficult social relations, emotional dysregulation, and inattention. However, there are no studies of lead exposure and tactile defensiveness in children or animals in spite of the fact that lead exposure is also associated with inattention and emotional dysregulation. OBJECTIVES: In this study we tested whether lead exposure induces tactile defensiveness in rhesus monkeys. METHODS: We tested 61 monkeys from a 3 (no lead, 1-year lead, 2-year lead) x 2 (succimer chelation or not) factorial experiment for tactile defensiveness at 4 years of age. Lead-treated monkeys had been orally administered lead in a daily milk solution from 8 days of life to either 1 or 2 years of age to produce blood lead levels of 35-40 mg/dL. Succimer chelation therapy or placebo was administered at 1 year of age. We measured tactile defensiveness using six repeated trials of each of three textures as a swipe to the cheek and neck. RESULTS: Lead-exposed monkeys showed higher negative responses to repeated tactile stimulation compared with controls. Blood lead during the first 3 months of life was positively correlated with the negative response on the tactile defensiveness test. There was an interaction of lead exposure x succimer chelation x trials, but it is not clear that succimer chelation was beneficial with respect to tactile defensiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to implicate lead as a potential cause of tactile defensiveness. Research should examine whether lead exposure is associated with tactile defensiveness in children.<p>

OBJECTIVES: To determine the influence of timing, infarct location and thrombolytic therapy on the electrocardiographic (ECG) response to exercise testing following acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Maximal treadmill exercise testing was performed on postinfarction day 8 and repeated on day 90 as part of a previously reported double-blind, placebo controlled study of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in acute myocardial infarction in which left ventricular function was the primary end-point. Patients were systematically evaluated for left ventricular function, myocardial perfusion and coronary anatomy. SETTING: Ten collaborating community and academic hospitals. PATIENTS: One hundred and fifteen patients, aged 20 to 75 years, with ischemic chest pain 30 mins or longer and ST elevation on ECG. Patients with cardiogenic shock, left bundle branch block, prior aortocoronary bypass surgery, recent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or standard contraindications to thrombolytic therapy were excluded. MAIN RESULTS: The analysis is confined to the 70 patients who underwent both exercise tests without intercurrent coronary revascularization. Peak rate-pressure product was greater on day 90 than on day 8 (mean difference +/- SE 2.2 +/- 0.6 x 10(3), P = 0.001), whereas 65% of patients had 1 mm or greater of exercise-induced ST shift on day 8 compared with 47% on day 90 (P = 0.025). Patients following anterior compared with inferior infarction were more likely to have exercise-induced ST elevation (54% versus 21%, P = 0.012) but less likely to have ST depression (29% versus 63%, P = 0.017) on day 8; results were directionally similar on day 90. Treatment with rt-PA, compared with placebo, did not influence exercise performance, the ECG response to exercise or the extent of inducible ischemia on thallium scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: Timing and infarct location are important modifiers of the ECG response to exercise testing following myocardial infarction.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key enzyme in the counter-regulation of insulin signaling and in the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis. Selenium (Se), via the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), is involved in the removal of H(2)O(2) and organic peroxides, which are critical compounds in the modulation of PTP1B activity via glutathionylation. Our study with growing rats investigated how the manipulation of dietary Se concentration influences the regulation of PTP1B and lipogenic effects mediated by PTP1B. Weanling albino rats were divided into 3 groups of 10. The negative control group (NC) was fed a Se-deficient diet for 8 wk. Rats in groups Se75 and Se150 received diets supplemented with 75 or 150 microg Se/kg. Se supplementation of the rats strongly influenced expression and activity of the selenoenzymes cytosolic GPx, plasma GPx, phospholipidhydroperoxide GPx, and cytosolic TrxR, and liver PTP1B. Liver PTP1B activity was significantly higher in groups Se75 and Se150 than in the NC group and this was attributed to a lowered inhibition of the enzyme by glutathionylation. The increased liver PTP1B activity in groups Se75 and Se150 resulted in 1.1- and 1.4-fold higher liver triglyceride concentrations than in the NC rats. The upregulation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and of fatty acid synthase, 2 PTP1B targets, provided a possible explanation for the lipogenic effect of PTP1B due to the manipulation of dietary Se. We therefore conclude that redox-regulated proteins, such as PTP1B, represent important interfaces between dietary antioxidants such as Se and the regulation of metabolic processes.<p>

The media has given much attention to the academic cheating crisis in America. A majority of college students believe that, in today's global environment, it is necessary to cheat in order to get ahead and to compete with their peers. The prevalence and attitudes concerning academic dishonesty of health professions students, including those in medical, dental, and nursing schools, have been extensively researched. No such studies exist in the discipline of dental hygiene. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of cheating in Texas dental hygiene programs. Four hundred surveys were mailed to twenty Texas dental hygiene schools for graduating students to complete. A total of 289 usable surveys was returned for a response rate of 72.25 percent. Data were analyzed using SPSS with frequencies and chi-square tests. Findings from this study reveal that 86.5 percent of graduating Texas dental hygiene students have cheated a minimum of one time during matriculation. Students identified the demands of what they considered academic overload as the primary justification for cheating behavior.<p>

UNLABELLED: Adolescent patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) are treated either in pediatric, or in adult oncological wards. AIM: The aim of our work was to compare the treatment modalities and the survival rates in adolescents with HL treated in adult (A) or pediatric (P) institutes. METHODS: From January 1990 to December 2004, 138 patients (14-21 years) with HL were treated in two adult institutes (A) and 107 in the 10 centres of the Hungarian Pediatric Oncology Network (P). RESULTS: Male:female ratio was 1:1.15 (A) and 1:1.38 (P). The mean age was 18.6 (A) and 15.7 (P) years. There was no difference between the distribution of the stages in the two patient groups. The distribution of histological subtypes (A and P): nodular sclerosing 47% and 59%, mixed cellularity 45% and 25%, lymphocyte rich 1.5% and 10%, lymphocyte depleted 4% and 1%, nodular lymphocyte predominant 1.5% and 3% and unknown 1% and 2%. The majority of the patients were treated with ABVD (A) and OPPA/OEPA +/- COPP (P). One hundred and fifteen (A) and 97 (P) adolescents received irradiation therapy. 80% (A) and 91% (A) of the patients got radiotherapy. In group A 14%, in group P 13% of the patients had relapse. In group A 16 patients died and in group P 7. There was no significant difference in the overall survival (OS) rates at 5 and 10 years in the two patient groups. The event-free survival (EFS) was 76.5 +/- 4% and 72.5 +/- 4% at 5 and 10 years in group A, and 85.3 +/- 4% at both times in group P ( p = 0.0452). CONCLUSION: Survival rates in HL are quite high, 80-90% of the patients can be cured. Event-free survival was higher in pediatric than in adult institutes. In case of patients younger than 18 years, the survival rates were much better in pediatric institutes, so these patients should be treated in pediatric institutes or with protocols used by the pediatricians.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Breast carcinoma classification has dramatically changed in recent years following application of molecular techniques. Immunohistochemistry can help select patients for different therapies. The objective of the present report is to determine the prognostic influence of the molecular classification of breast carcinoma with immunohistochemistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have retrospectively selected a cohort of 257 patients with invasive ductal carcinoma NOS diagnosed and treated in the same hospital between 1997 and 2000. We have classified the cases in four tumor types according to the immunohistochemical expression of several markers, as luminal A tumors [estrogen and/or progesterone receptors (ER/PE) positive and Her-2 negative]; luminal B tumors (ER/PR positive and Her-2 positive); Her-2 positive tumors (ER/PR negative with Her-2 positive); and triple negative phenotype (all markers negative). RESULTS: In our series, 116 patients had tumors of luminal A type (47.93%); 67 (27.68%) were luminal type B; 33 (13.63%) were Her2 positive; and 26 (10.74%) were triple negative. The recurrence rate was 19% for luminal type A tumors, 25.4% for luminal type B, 39.4% for Her2 positive and 30.8% for triple negative lesions. The mean relapse free survival was 79.07, 73.07, 64.3 and 83,5 months for luminal A and B, Her-2 and triple negative lesions, respectively. Mortality rate reached 11.2% for luminal A tumors compared with 19.4, 33.3 and 26.9% for luminal B, Her2 and triple negative tumors, respectively. The mean overall survival for these groups was 88.42, 81.41, 77.62 and 93.6 months. CONCLUSION: Molecular classification with immunohistochemistry behaves as a significant prognosticator for breast invasive ductal carcinoma in our series of patients. The worse prognosis observed for Her2 expressing lesions may have changed after trastuzumab use.<p>

To study determinants for changes in maternal smoking behaviour during and after pregnancy, questionnaire information on smoking habits was recorded in a cohort of 3710 Norwegian women during early pregnancy, at delivery, and one year later. Of 3039 cohabiting women with complete information on smoking at all three occasions 31% smoked in early pregnancy 23% in the late pregnancy and 28% one year after delivery. Among the cohabiting mothers who smoked in early pregnancy, 44% stopped during pregnancy. After adjusting for confounding factors, the odds ratio for smoking cessation among these women who had cohabitants who smoked as opposed to not smoking was 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.2). Among cohabiting non-smoking women during late pregnancy the odds ratio for being a smoker one year after child birth was 3.0 (95% CI: 2.2-4.0), if their cohabitants smoked as opposed to not smoking. The women's smoking behaviour changes considerably during and after pregnancy and their cohabitants' smoking seems to be a major determinant for changes in their smoking behaviour.<p>

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the role of siblings in day care as a determinant of infants' risk of lower respiratory tract infections. METHODS: A total of 3238 children (86%) out of 3754 Oslo, Norway, newborns recruited in 1992/93 were followed for 1 year. RESULTS: In logistic regression analysis, the risk of infection was increased in (1) infants with one or more siblings compared with infants without siblings (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.84, 2.85) and (2) infants with one or more siblings in day care compared with infants with siblings not in day care (adjusted OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.21, 2.26). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that siblings in day care outside the home increase infants' risk of lower respiratory tract infections.<p>

The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between breastfeeding and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) during the first year of life, with special reference to maternal smoking. A cohort of 3,754 children born in 1992-1993 in the City of Oslo, Norway was recruited and data were collected at birth, 6 and 12 months of age. Complete information was obtained from 3,238 children (follow-up rate 86%). The main outcome was an episode of a LRTI, such as pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis, based on a self-administered questionnaire addressed to parents when the child was 6 and 12 months old. The outcome was specified as physician-diagnosed. In logistic regression analysis adjusting for confounding, maternal smoking increased the risk of LRTIs in children breastfed for 0-6 months (odds ratio (AOR) 1.7; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.2-2.4), but not essentially when the child was breastfed for more than 6 months (AOR 1.1; 95% CI 0.7-1.6). Short-term breastfeeding (0-6 months) and no maternal smoking was related to an adjusted AOR of LRTIs of 1.3 (95% CI 1.0-1.7), and short-term breastfeeding combined with maternal smoking was related to an adjusted AOR of 2.2 (95% CI 1.6-3.1), as compared with long-term breastfeeding and no maternal smoking. The present study indicates a protective effect of long-term breastfeeding on the risk of lower respiratory tract infection during the first year of life. The results suggest that the protective effect is strongest in children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.<p>

Tissue concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin (TBDD) and induction of ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) were determined in female Wistar rats following a single subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of TBDD. Two sets of experiments were performed in order to study (a) the time course after a single s.c. administration of 600 ng TBDD/kg body wt up to 78 days, and (b) the dose-response seven days after a single s.c. injection of different doses of TBDD (3 to 3,000 ng/kg body wt). The results obtained on toxicokinetics and enzyme induction were compared with those following a single s.c. administration of 300 ng/kg body wt 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Three days after the injection, approximately 93% of TBDD and 90% of TCDD had been absorbed. Fourteen days after s.c. injection less than 1% of the administered dose of both substances remained at the injection site. Three days after a single s.c. injection of 600 ng TBDD/kg body wt and 300 ng TCDD/kg body wt, the maximum tissue concentrations in the liver amounted to (M +/- S.D.) 5.7 +/- 0.8 and 4.7 +/- 0.9 ng/g wet weight, respectively. In adipose tissue, the peak concentration was 3.2 +/- 0.2 ng/g wet weight for TBDD on day 14, and 0.8 +/- 0.1 ng/g for TCDD on day 7. Throughout the study, the concentration ratio in the TCDD-treated group was always at least twice as high as that in the TBDD-treated group. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of TBDD and of TCDD in the liver was 13.3 and 13.6 days, respectively. In the adipose tissue the t1/2 of TCDD was 24.5 days but no reliable t1/2 could be calculated for TBDD (t1/2 = 39.4 days with a 95% confidence interval of 25.9 to 82.4 days). Tissue content of TBDD and TCDD in liver and adipose tissue increased dose-dependently, and the linear regression in a double-logarithmic plot showed a straight line. Time course of the induction of hepatic EROD activity after treatment with 600 ng TBDD/kg body wt was almost identical with that observed following a single dose of 300 ng TCDD/kg body wt. The induction of hepatic EROD activity was linearly correlated in a double-logarithmic plot to the hepatic concentrations of the congeners (both TBDD and TCDD). The slopes of the dose-response curves after administration of TBDD and TCDD were almost parallel for tissue concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 30 ng/g wet weight.<p>

Hydrogels based on peptide self-assembly form an important class of biomaterials that find application in tissue engineering and drug delivery. It is essential to prepare peptides with high purity to achieve batch-to-batch consistency affording hydrogels with reproducible properties. Automated solid-phase peptide synthesis coupled with optimized Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl) chemistry to obtain peptides in high yield and purity is discussed. Details of isolating a desired peptide from crude synthetic mixtures and assessment of the peptide's final purity by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are provided. Beyond the practical importance of synthesis and primary characterization, techniques used to investigate the properties of hydrogels are briefly discussed.<p>

An initial and crucial step in the establishment of many microbial infections is the attachment of the pathogen to the host cells. Thus, adherence of Pneumocystis carinii (Pc) to type I pneumocytes is believed to be important in the induction of Pc pneumonia. Little is known about the nature of the attachment of Pc to type I cells, although extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, have been implicated in the process. We report here the isolation of a Pc gene encoding a receptor protein that binds both fibronectin and laminin in vitro. A cDNA clone encoding the Pc ECM receptor was isolated from a Pc cDNA library and identified on the basis of sequence homology to the human colon carcinoma laminin receptor. Southern blot analysis of Pc genomic DNA confirmed that the cDNA was of Pc origin. Northern blot analysis of Pc total RNA showed a predominant mRNA of approximately 1400 nucleotides that hybridized to the ECM receptor gene. The ECM receptor predicted from the cDNA sequence is 295 amino acid residues long, with a molecular mass of 32.8 kDa. The C-terminal third of the polypeptide is highly negatively charged, whereas the N-terminal two-thirds contains hydrophobic segments that may play a role in membrane association. Sequence analysis and alignment of the N terminus with the laminin receptor cDNA sequence of human colon carcinoma support the conclusion that the Pc ECM receptor cDNA clone is a full-length clone. A Western blot of the overexpressed ECM receptor protein bound both laminin and fibronectin in vitro. Antibodies raised to the overexpressed receptor protein interacted with a 33-kDa protein in total Pc cell lysates. These findings raise the possibility that the Pc ECM receptor protein may mediate the organism's attachment to type I pneumocytes and, thus, may play a crucial role in Pc pathogenesis.<p>

False aneurysms of the left ventricle are a rare complication of myocardial infarction. They pose a high risk of cardiac rupture and death in the immediate stages following infarction. The long term fate of these aneurysms is less clear. Based on early reports, the current practice is to resect all false aneurysms regardless of their age. Three patients were found to have false aneurysms several years (seven to 12) following their index infarction. Two of the patients were asymptomatic at presentation and their aneurysms were discovered by echocardiography. All three patients underwent successful surgical repair. The literature on false aneurysms is reviewed and analyzed. With the wide availability of high quality noninvasive imaging there has been an increase in the reporting of unsuspected false aneurysms in the past decade. The need for prophylactic aneurysectomy of stable asymptomatic chronic false ventricular aneurysms is not well supported by available data in the literature. A strategy of conservative management with noninvasive follow-up may be a more appropriate alternative.<p>

The elements that regulate O-glycosylation are poorly understood. We have developed a novel in vivo system to analyze the role of flanking sequence on the modification of a single well characterized O-glycosylation site derived from human von Willebrand factor (PHMAQVTVGPGL). A secreted chimeric reporter protein, containing the human von Willebrand factor sequence, an antibody recognition epitope, and a heart muscle kinase site, was engineered and expressed in COS7 and MCF-7 cells. Glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of the immunoprecipitated reporter were resolved electrophoretically and their relative amounts quantitated. Using mutational analysis we find that the glycosylation apparatus of COS7 cells can accommodate a broad range of changes in the flanking sequence without compromising glycosylation, but that the distribution of charged amino acids flanking the O-glycosylation site can have a profound influence on glycosylation with position -1 relative to the glycosylation site being particularly sensitive. A combination of acidic residues at positions -1 and +3 almost completely eliminates glycosylation of the reporter in both COS7 and MCF-7 cells. The overall density of charged amino acids is less important since substitution of acidic residues at position -2, +1, and +2 had no effect in the level of glycosylation observed.<p>

Non-malignant fibrosing tumors in the pediatric hand or juvenile fibromatoses are clinically challenging because of their relatively infrequent occurrence and because of the variety of names associated with these diseases. We conducted a review of a personal case series of pediatric patients with these tumors and discuss here the more common histologic types and clinical characteristics of the disease spectrum in the context of the available published literature. All histologic samples were reviewed by a single pathologist. Infantile myofibromatosis, fibrous hamartoma of infancy, juvenile aponeurotic fibromatosis, palmar fibromatosis (Dupuytren's type), infantile digital fibromatosis (Reye's tumor), fibroma of the tendon sheath, and melorheostosis represent the encountered lesions.<p>

Adventure racing is a wilderness multisport endurance event with the potential for significant injury and illness; however specific contributing factors have not been extensively studied. A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted that collected data during the 2005 Adventure Racing World Championship on pre-, in- and post-race injury and illness and determined pre-race training volumes and health profiles in 184 athletes (46 teams of 4 athletes). In the 6 months prior to the event, 79.9% of athletes reported an injury or illness. Fifty-nine cases of injury or illness were recorded during the race; representing an overall rate of 2.5 injuries per 1000 race-hours and 1.0 illness per 1000 race-hours. This incidence could be considered low compared to some sports, but the rate is tempered by the time on course exposure of 16,774 race-hours. Respiratory conditions were the single-most common condition resulting in race withdrawal. There was a moderate, but not statistically significantly, association (OR=4.61, p=0.083, 95% CI 0.82-26.08) between pre-race illness and in-race illness. Forty-four (95%) teams responded to a post-race questionnaire with 30% of the athletes reporting a new injury and 12% reporting a new illness in the week following the race. Understanding contributing factors to injury and illness during adventure racing will aid implementation of race medical coverage, preventative strategies and increase participation and performance.<p>

The clinical spectrum of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is different from that in adults, with frequent extranodal involvement. CT scanning as part of routine staging appears to show more frequent sites of extranodal disease than were previously recognized. We have reviewed the CT and other radiological findings in 80 children with NHL to document the incidence and radiological appearance of visceral involvement, to compare this with the pattern of adult disease, and to assess how frequently clinical stage of disease was altered by radiological findings. The age of the children ranged from 9 months to 17 years 4 months (mean 9 years 2 months). The presenting site was in the abdomen in 21 (27%), extranodal sites in the head and neck in 18 (23%), mediastinum in 16 (20%), peripheral lymph nodes in 15 (19%), pelvic organs in four, skin in four, and bone in two. Fifteen children had gastrointestinal lymphoma, the majority involving the ileocaecal junction. The kidneys were involved in 10 children, the pancreas in three; no child with renal or pancreatic involvement had associated retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement. Eight children had bone involvement and only two of the 80 children had pulmonary nodules at presentation. In this series, of the 44 children who had CT of the chest and abdomen, only five had stage of disease increased as a result, three with the primary disease in peripheral lymph nodes, and two with the primary disease in extranodal sites in the head and neck.<p>

1. The spiders of medical importance in the Asia-Pacific region include widow (family Theridiidae) and Australian funnel-web spiders (subfamily Atracinae). In addition, cupboard (family Theridiidae) and Australian mouse spiders (family Actinopodidae) may contain neurotoxins responsible for serious systemic envenomation. Fortunately, there appears to be extensive cross-reactivity of species-specific widow spider antivenom within the family Theridiidae. Moreover, Sydney funnel-web antivenom has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mouse spider envenomation. 2. alpha-Latrotoxin (alpha-LTx) appears to be the main neurotoxin responsible for the envenomation syndrome known as &quot;latrodectism&quot; following bites from widow spiders. This 120 kDa protein binds to distinct receptors (latrophilin 1 and neurexins) to induce neurotransmitter vesicle exocytosis via both Ca2+-dependent and -independent mechanisms, resulting in vesicle depletion. This appears to involve disruption to a process that normally inhibits vesicle fusion in the absence of Ca2+. Precise elucidation of the mechanism of action of alpha-LTx will lead to a major advancement in our understanding of vesicle exocytosis. 3. delta-Atracotoxins (delta-ACTX) are responsible for the primate-specific envenomation syndrome seen following funnel-web spider envenomation. These peptides induce spontaneous repetitive firing and prolongation of action potentials in excitable cells. This results from a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage-dependence of activation and a slowing of voltage-gated Na+ channel inactivation. This action is due to voltage-dependent binding to neurotoxin receptor site-3 on insect and mammalian voltage-gated Na+ channels in a manner similar, but not identical, to scorpion alpha-toxins and sea anemone toxins. delta-Atracotoxins provide us with highly specific tools to study Na+ channel structure and function 4. omega- and Janus-faced ACTX, from funnel-web spider venom, are novel neurotoxins that show selective toxicity to insects. In particular omega-ACTX define a new insecticide target due to a specific action to block insect voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Both these ACTX show promise for the development of baculoviral recombinant biopesticides expressing these toxins for the control of insecticide-resistant agricultural pests. In addition, they should provide valuable tools for the pharmacological and structural characterization of insecticide targets.<p>

Activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidases (PER) were examined at 24-h intervals during Drosophila development. SOD activities show a U-shaped curve from egg to adult stages whereas CAT and PER are consistently low in egg through larval stages. Male and female larvae have similar activities of SOD, CAT, and PER whereas male adults have elevated activities of these enzymes. Larvae are more sensitive to H2O2 and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (an inhibitor of CAT) than adults.<p>

Death in circulation is one of the natural barriers preventing dissemination of tumor cells and formation of metastases. One of the negative factors acting in circulation is the loss of cell contact with natural substrate which can be imitated in vitro by the incubation of cells in suspension or in semi-solid media. Normal mouse fibroblasts (MEFs) stay viable in suspension and undergo p53-independent G1 growth arrest. Transformation with Ela and ras oncogenes leads to the abrogation of this arrest and to the p53-dependent apoptosis occurring in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Suppression of apoptosis by p53 gene knock-out, transduction of dominant negative p53 mutant or bcl-2 prevents death in suspension and greatly induces frequency of colony formation in semi-solid media. The ability of cells to undergo apoptosis does not correlate with their tumorigenicity in nude mice but does correlate with their ability to survive in lungs of intravenously injected mice and to form experimental metastases. We suggest that abrogation of a p53-mediated apoptosis facilitates experimental metastasis by promoting survival of tumor cells in circulation.<p>

Phenoloxidases and hemocyanins have similar type 3 copper centers although they perform different functions. Hemocyanins are oxygen carriers, while phenoloxidases (tyrosinase/catecholoxidase) catalyze the initial step in melanin synthesis. Tyrosinases catalyze two subsequent reactions, whereas catecholoxidases catalyze only the second one. Recent results indicate that hemocyanins can also function as phenoloxidases and here we show for the first time that hemocyanin can be converted to phenoloxidase. Furthermore, its substrate specificity can be switched between catecholoxidase and tyrosinase activity depending on effectors such as hydroxymethyl-aminomethan (Tris) and Mg(2+)-ions. This demonstrates that substrate specificity is not caused by a chemical modification of the active site.<p>

The spontaneous growth process in Turner's syndrome is characterized by a progressive decline in height velocity during childhood and no pubertal growth spurt. Therefore, therapy aimed at improving height during childhood as well as increasing final height is desirable for most girls with Turner's syndrome. Forty-five girls with Turner's syndrome, 9-16 yr of age (mean age, 12.2 yr), were allocated to three study groups. Group 1 (n = 13) was initially treated with oxandrolone alone; after 1 yr of treatment, GH without (group 1a; n = 6) or with (group 1b; n = 7) ethinyl estradiol was added. Group 2 (n = 17) was treated with GH plus oxandrolone. Group 3 (n = 15) was treated with GH, oxandrolone, and ethinyl estradiol. The dosage were: GH, 0.1 IU/kg.day; oxandrolone, 0.05 mg/kg.day; and ethinyl estradiol, 100 ng/kg.day. A height of 150 cm or more was achieved in 61%, 75%, and 60% of the girls in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The most impressive increase in height was seen in group 2. In this group the mean final height was 154.2 cm (SD = 6.6), which is equivalent to a mean net gain of 8.5 cm (SD = 4.6) over the projected final height. In group 3, in which ethinyl estradiol was included from the start of therapy, the initially good height velocity decelerated after 1-2 yr of treatment. Their mean final height was 151.1 (SD = 4.6) cm, equivalent to a mean net gain of 3.0 cm (SD = 3.8). A similar growth-decelerating effect of ethinyl estradiol was seen in group 1b. We conclude that in girls with Turner's syndrome who are older than 9 yr of age, treatment with GH in combination with oxandrolone results in significant growth acceleration, imitating that in normal puberty, leading to a more favorable height during childhood. This mode of treatment also results in a significantly increased final height, permitting a great number of the girls to attain a final height of more than 150 cm. However, early addition of estrogen decelerates the height velocity and reduces the gain in height.<p>

The contraction-relaxation cycle of the heart is dependent on a cycle of ATP production and utilization and a cycle of Ca uptake and Ca release by the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Heart failure (HF) is associated with abnormalities of myocardial Ca and ATP cycling, but the time course of their development is unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that, compared with ATP-utilizing and Ca-uptake activities, decreases in ATP-synthesis and Ca-release activities occurred earlier in the development of HF and persisted longer during recovery from HF. HF was induced by right ventricular pacing of dogs at 250 beats/min. Dogs were studied after 1 week of pacing (n = 8, early HF), at HF (n = 11, severe HF), and 4 weeks after cessation of pacing (n = 9) and were compared with dogs not subjected to pacing. At early HF, there were decreased activities (p &lt; 0.05) of the SR Ca-release channel (rate constant from 199 +/- 36 x 10(-4) to 90 +/- 16 x 10(-4) s-1), mitochondrial ATP synthesis (from 11.2 +/- 2.4 to 7.0 +/- 2.2 international units (IU)/g), and creatine kinase (CK) from 2028 +/- 266 to 1811 +/- 79 IU/g). The decreased Ca-channel activity was due to a 32% decrease in maximal activity (rate constant from 249 +/- 50 x 10(-4) to 170 +/- 29 x 10(-4) s-1) and to a 2-fold increase (from 19.1 +/- 12.4 to 42.0 +/- 14.2%) in inhibition of maximal channel activity (p &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

OBJECTIVE: To analyse profiles of coronary artery flow velocity at rest in patients with aortic stenosis and to determine whether changes of the coronary artery flow velocities are related to symptoms in patients with aortic stenosis. DESIGN: A prospective study investigating the significance of aortic valve area, pressure gradient across the aortic valve, systolic left ventricular wall stress index, ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass index in the coronary flow velocity profile of aortic stenosis; and comparing flow velocity profiles between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis using transoesophageal Doppler echocardiography to obtain coronary artery flow velocities of the left anterior descending coronary artery. SETTING: Tertiary referral cardiac centre. PATIENTS: Fifty eight patients with aortic stenosis and 15 controls with normal coronary arteries. RESULTS: Adequate recordings of the profile of coronary artery flow velocities were obtained in 46 patients (79%). Left ventricular wall stress was the only significant haemodynamic variable for determining peak systolic velocity (r = -0.83, F = 88.5, P &lt; 0.001). The pressure gradient across the aortic valve was the only contributor for explaining peak diastolic velocity (r = 0.56, F = 20.9, P &lt; 0.001). Controls and asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (n = 12) did not differ for peak systolic velocity [32.8 (SEM 9.7) v 27.0 (8.7) cm/s, NS] and peak diastolic velocity [58.3 (18.7) v 61.9 (13.5) cm/s, NS]. In contrast, patients with angina (n = 12) or syncope (n = 8) had lower peak systolic velocities and higher peak diastolic velocities than asymptomatic patients (P &lt; 0.01). Peak systolic and diastolic velocities were -7.7 (22.5) cm/s and 81.7 (17.6) cm/s for patients with angina, and -19.5 (22.3) cm/s and 94.0 (20.9) cm/s for patients with syncope. Asymptomatic patients and patients with dyspnoea (n = 14) did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Increased pressure gradient across the aortic valve and enhanced systolic wall stress result in characteristic changes of the profile of coronary flow velocities in patients with aortic stenosis. Decreased or reversed systolic flow velocities are compensated by enhanced diastolic flow velocities, particularly in patients with angina and syncope. This characteristic pattern of the profile of coronary artery flow velocities in patients with angina or syncope may be useful for differentiating those patients from asymptomatic patients.<p>

Omran, H., et al. (1996). &quot;Valvular aortic stenosis: risk of syncope.&quot; <u>Journal of Heart Valve Disease</u> <b>5</b>(1): 31-34.<p>
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Syncope is a serious complication of aortic stenosis. The aim of this study was to determine whether hemodynamic parameters are useful for estimating the risk of syncope in aortic stenosis. METHODS: In 43 patients with aortic stenosis, cardiac catheterization and echocardiography were performed to measure the pressure gradient across the aortic valve, the aortic valve area, left ventricular mass index, systolic left ventricular wall stress and peak systolic coronary artery flow velocities. Hemodynamic parameters were correlated with syncope and the accuracy of those parameters for determining the risk of syncope were assessed. RESULTS: Ten out of 43 patients experienced syncope. The highest correlation with syncope was found for systolic left ventricular wall stress (R = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001). In descending order of correlation were peak systolic coronary artery flow velocity (R = 0.68, p = 0.002), the pressure gradient across the aortic valve (R = 0.62, p = 0.01) and the aortic valve area (R = 0.43, p = 0.03). Left ventricular mass index was not significantly correlated with syncope. Multivariate analysis revealed systolic left ventricular wall stress to be the only factor contributing to determining syncope (F-to-remove: 47.8). A discriminative value of &gt; 225 dyn/cm-2 x 103 for left ventricular wall stress identified patients with a history of syncope with a specificity of 97% and a sensitivity of 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Syncope in aortic stenosis is closely correlated to increased left ventricular wall stress and attenuated, peak systolic coronary flow velocities. Cut off values may be used to identify patients with an increased risk of syncope.<p>

A major requirement for a new experimental protocol, particularly if it involves manipulation of the donor marrow, is that the manipulated marrow gives rise to long-term multilineage engraftment. DNA based methodologies are now routinely used by many centres to evaluate engraftment and degree of chimaerism post-BMT in humans. We report the adaptation of this methodology to the serial study of engraftment in rodents. Conditions have been defined which allow analysis of serial tail vein samples using PCR of short tandem repeat sequences (STR-PCR). These markers have been used to evaluate the contribution of ultraviolet B treated marrow to engraftment following BMT in rodents without compromising the health of the animals under study. Chimaerism data from sequential tail vein samples and bone marrow from selected sacrificed animals showed excellent correlation, thus confirming the validity of this approach in analysing haemopoietic tissue. Thus the use of this assay may facilitate experimental studies in animal BMT.<p>

As part of a comprehensive study of X-ray emission from planetary surfaces and in particular the planet Mercury, we have measured fluorescent radiation from a number of planetary analog rock samples using monochromatized synchrotron radiation provided by the BESSY II electron storage ring. The experiments were carried out using a purpose built X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer chamber developed by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, Germany's national metrology institute. The XRF instrumentation is absolutely calibrated and allows for reference-free quantitation of rock sample composition, taking into account secondary photon- and electron-induced enhancement effects. The fluorescence data, in turn, have been used to validate a planetary fluorescence simulation tool based on the GEANT4 transport code. This simulation can be used as a mission analysis tool to predict the time-dependent orbital XRF spectral distributions from planetary surfaces throughout the mapping phase.<p>

We report a measurement of the exclusive e+ e- --&gt;Lambda+_(c)Lambda-_(c) cross section as a function of center-of-mass energy near the Lambda+_(c)Lambda-_(c) threshold. A clear peak with a significance of 8.2sigma is observed in the Lambda+_(c)Lambda-_(c) invariant mass distribution just above threshold. With an assumption of a resonance origin for the observed peak, a mass and width of M=[4634 (+8)_(-7)(stat)(+5)_(-8)(syst)] MeV/c(2) and Gamma_(tot)=[92 (+40)_(-24)(stat)(+10)_(-21)(syst)] MeV are determined. The analysis is based on a study of events with initial-state-radiation photons in a data sample collected with the Belle detector at the Upsilon(4S) resonance and nearby continuum with an integrated luminosity of 695 fb(-1) at the KEKB asymmetric-energy e+ e- collider.<p>

Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations in exon 12 represent the most frequent molecular aberrations in adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Molecular detection of NPM1 mutation A could be a useful marker for routine monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD). We established a calibrator-normalized relative quantification real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for NPM1 mutation A. ABL1 was used as a reference housekeeping gene and the NPM1 mutation A-containing OCI/AML3 cell line as a calibrator. Relative quantification was performed by calculating the NPM1 mutation A/ABL1 ratio which was normalized to the NPM1 mutation A/ABL1 ratio of OCI/AML3 calibrator cDNA. The assay showed a sensitivity of 10(-5). The clinical usefulness was evaluated by monitoring MRD in 51 AML patients with NPM1 mutation A. In 27 patients analysed at diagnosis and after induction treatment, NPM1 mutation A ratios showed a median log(10) reduction of 2.48, which correlated with response to therapy. Among the 51 patients, 21 relapsed and two lost the mutation. We established a sensitive, specific and reproducible assay for routine quantification and monitoring of NPM1 mutation A levels. However, clonal evolution was observed in 9.5% limiting the usefulness of the NPM1 mutation A mutation as a molecular marker in these patients.<p>

Xenorhabdus nematophilus is a Gram-negative symbiotic bacterium of the entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae. The bacteria delivered into the insect hemocoel by the nematodes cause immunodepression of the target insects to protect host nematodes and themselves from the cellular immune reaction. Previous reports suggest that the immunodepression is caused by inhibition of the eicosanoid pathway that is known to be critically important to mediate cellular immunity. This study focused on the inhibitory effect of X. nematophilus on PLA2 activity of Spodoptera exigua. The PLA2 activity was functionally associated with the activation cascade of prophenoloxidase (pPO). Dexamethasone (DEX), a specific PLA2 inhibitor, inhibited pPO activation completely at the higher doses of approximately 2.4 muM in vitro condition. The inhibitory effect of DEX was reversed by the addition of arachidonic acid, the catalytic product of PLA2. By means of this in vitro PLA2 inhibitor assay system, two different PLA2 inhibitors were used to compare their inhibitory effects on the hemolymph PLA2 of S. exigua. p-Bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), a specific inhibitor of secretory PLA2 (sPLA2), significantly inhibited pPO activation, but methylarachidonyl fluorophosphates (MAFP), a specific inhibitor of cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2), did not show any inhibitory effect. BPB also inhibited pPO activation of the plasma, though much higher PO activation and its inhibition by BPB was found in the hemocytes. Growth medium of X. nematophilus at the stationary phase had a PLA2 inhibitory effect. Via the in vitro PLA2 inhibitor assay, it was shown that the ethyl ether extract of the medium contained significant PLA2 inhibitor activity. These results indicate that X. nematophilus produces and secretes PLA2 inhibitor, which acts on BPB-susceptible PLA2 of S. exigua.<p>

The bacterium, Xenorhabdus nematophilus, is a virulent insect pathogen. We tested the hypothesis that this bacterium impairs insect cellular immune defense reactions by inhibiting biosynthesis of eicosanoids involved in mediating cellular defense reactions. Fifth instar tobacco hornworms, Manduca sexta, produced melanized nodules in reaction to challenge with living and heat-killed X. nematophilus. However, the nodulation reactions were much attenuated in insects challenged with living bacteria (approximately 20 nodules/larva for living bacteria vs. approximately 80 nodules/larva in insects challenged with heat-killed bacteria). The nodule-inhibiting action of living X. nematophilus was due to a factor that was present in the organic, but not aqueous, fraction of the bacterial cultural medium. The nodule-inhibiting factor in the organic fraction was labile to heat treatments. The immunodepressive influence of the factor in the organic fraction was reversed by treating challenged hornworms with arachidonic acid. The factor also depressed nodulation reactions to challenge with the plant pathogenic bacteria, Pseudomonas putida and Ralstonia solanacearum. These findings indicate that one or more factors from X. nematophilus depress nodulation reactions in tobacco hornworms by inhibiting eicosanoid biosynthesis.<p>

The European DNA Profiling (EDNAP) Group performed a collaborative exercise on a mitochondrial (mt) DNA screening assay that targeted 16 nucleotide positions in the coding region and allowed for the discrimination of major west Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups. The purpose of the exercise was to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of the self-developed multiplex-PCR and multiplex-single base extension kit by blind-testing saliva and hair shaft samples provided by the organizing laboratory. The overall success rate in obtaining useful results was high given that some of the participating laboratories had no previous experience with the technology and/or mtDNA analysis. The results of this collaborative exercise stimulate the expansion of screening methods in forensic laboratories to increase efficiency and performance of mtDNA typing, and thus demonstrates that mtDNA SNP typing is a powerful tool for forensic casework analysis.<p>

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the ability of five commercially available devices utilizing a variety of heat exchange technologies to deliver normothermic (37 degrees C) fluids. Conditions of slow (6.5 mL/ min), moderate (13-25 mL/min), and rapid (gravity and pressure driven flows, roller clamp wide open) infusion were simulated. Fluid temperatures were measured using rapid response thermistors after the fluid exited the heat exchanger (T outlet) and before delivery to the patient intravenously (IV) (T distal). Devices tested were the FW537, H1000, Hotline, BairHugger, and Flotem IIe. Fluids tested were crystalloid at room temperature and red cells diluted with saline (11-19 degrees C). At slow and moderate flows, T distal of crystalloid was between 35.3 and 37.9 degrees C for Hotline at 42 degrees C, 33.8 and 37.7 degrees C for H1000 at 42 degrees C, 29.4 and 34.2 degrees C for BairHugger, 26.1 and 31.5 for Flotem IIe, and 23.8 and 32.1 for FW537 at 42 degrees C. With gravity and pressure driven flows, T distal of crystalloid were 39.0 and 38.9 for H1000 at 42 degrees C, 38.7 and 38.4 degrees C for FW537 at 42 degrees C, 34.7 and 28.9 degrees C for Hotline at 42 degrees C, 29.2 and 24.2 degrees C for BairHugger, and 29.7 and 24.2 degrees C for Flotem. In conclusion, only the H1000 at 42 degrees C was effective at delivering normothermic fluids at all clinically relevant flow rates. The Hotline at 42 degrees C was effective at slow and moderate flow, whereas the FW537 was effective only at rapid flow.<p>

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare esophageal, tympanic membrane, and forehead skin temperatures in patients undergoing elective surgeries. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Operating room and postanesthesia care unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital. PATIENTS: 40 adult ASA status I, II and III patients requiring anesthesia and surgery. INTERVENTION: Application of crystalline thermometry strips to the forehead of patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Concurrent forehead skin, tympanic membrane, and lower esophageal temperatures were measured and compared. The overall bias between esophageal and skin temperatures was 0.3 degrees C, between tympanic membrane and skin was 0.5 degrees C, and between esophageal and tympanic membrane was -0.1 degrees C The limits of agreement (precision) between esophageal and skin temperatures were: -1.64 degrees C to +2.32 degrees C, between esophageal and tympanic membrane were: -1.02 degrees C to +0.74, and between tympanic membrane and skin were: -1.48 degrees C to +2.52 degrees C. There was no significant relation between the change in skin temperature and change in esophageal temperature, whereas there was a weak linear relation between change in skin temperature and change in tympanic membrane temperature (y = -0.03 + 0.09, r = 0.12). CONCLUSION: There was a lack of precision between the clinically accepted measurements (lower esophageal and tympanic membranes and the skin temperature measurement. The data suggest that forehead skin temperature is not interchangeable with standard core temperature measurements, and that sole reliance on the forehead skin measurement in the perioperative setting could adversely affect patient care.<p>

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the fluid warming capabilities of the Hotline and Flotem IIe devices in surgical patients, and whether warming intravenous (i.v.) fluids with the Hotline device resulted in less hypothermia and less need for other warming methods compared with the Flotem IIe device. STUDY DESIGN: Part 1. Prospective, nonrandomized. Part 2. Prospective, randomized. SETTING: Teaching hospital, tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Part 1. 24 adult patients undergoing elective surgery. Part 2. 49 adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopedic or gynecologic surgery of greater than 2 hours' duration with general anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Part 1. Insertion of sterile in-line thermistors along the path of fluids delivered using the Hotline or Flotem device. Part 2. Patients were randomly assigned to receive i.v. fluids via the Hotline (n = 21) or Flotem IIe (n = 18) warmers. Intervention for core hypothermia [lower esophageal temperature (Teso) less than 35.5 degrees C], was with forced air warming. Intervention for postoperative shivering was with meperidine by a nurse who was blinded to the treatment group. MEASUREMENTS: Part 1. Temperature of infused fluids before and after the warmer (T in and T out) and before the fluid entered the patient after insertion of a standard 84 cm extension set having a stopcock for injection of medications (T distal). Part 2. Tympanic (Ttym) was recorded before induction of anesthesia (baseline) and at 15-minute intervals after induction. Teso was recorded at 15-minute intervals after induction. The maximum intraoperative Ttym decline from baseline (delta Ttym max) was calculated. MAIN RESULTS: Part 1. Flow rates were between 1 and 33 ml/min. T out and T distal (mean +/- SEM) of fluids infused through the Hotline device were warmer compared with those infused via the Flotem IIe device (Hotline T out: 35.7 +/- 0.1 degrees C and Hotline T distal: 33.4 +/- 0.2 degrees C vs. Flotem IIe T out: 28.9 +/- 0.2 degrees C and Flotem IIe T distal: 28.3 +/- 0.2 degrees C; p &lt; 0.001 between warmers). Part 2. Maximal decrease in Ttym from preoperative baseline (before intervention) was greater in the Flotem IIe compared with the Hotline group (delta Ttym max = -1.4 +/- 0.1 vs. -0.9 +/- 0.1 degree C, p = 0.01). Five patients in the Flotem IIe group required forced air warming for treatment of hypothermia versus none in the Hotline group (p &lt; 0.01). Postoperatively, five patients in the Flotem IIe group required treatment with meperidine for severe shivering versus one patient in the Hotline group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The Hotline device delivered fluids to the patient at consistently warmer temperatures compared with the Flotem IIe device during actual clinical conditions. This was associated with maintenance of near normal core temperatures throughout the procedure in the Hotline group, and a decreased need for interventions such as forced-air warming and treatment for severe shivering.<p>

Patel, N., et al. (1996). &quot;Desflurane is not associated with faster operating room exit times in outpatients.&quot; <u>Journal of Clinical Anesthesia</u> <b>8</b>(2): 130-135.<p>
STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of anesthetic technique and primary drug on operating room (OR) exit time (time between end of surgery until time patient exists the OR) after addition of desflurane to the hospital formulary. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Ambulatory surgery unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: 1,568 outpatients requiring anesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Addition of desflurane to the hospital formulary, and substitution of desflurane vaporizers for enflurane vaporizers in the ambulatory surgery unit. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The following information was recorded for all anesthetic encounters over a six-month time interval: demographics, duration of surgery, primary anesthetic technique, primary anesthetic drug, and exit times. General anesthesia was used in 907 patients [desflurane: 209 patients, isoflurane: 429 patients, halothane: 192 patients, propofol: 72 patients, other intravenous (i.v.): 5 patients], major conduction anesthesia (spinal and epidural) in 43 patients, peripheral nerve blocks in 90 patients, and i.v. sedation in 528 patients. The exit time was significantly greater ( &lt; 0.05) in patients who received general anesthesia (mean +/- SEM 14 +/- 0.2 min) compared with spinal/epidural (8 +/- 0.7 min), nerve blocks (8 +/- 0.4 min) and i.v. sedation (7 +/- 0.2 min). Exit times were longer in older patients receiving general anesthesia (exit time = 12.3 + 0.04 x age, SE = 6.7 min, p &lt; 0.0009), whereas exit times were shorter in older individuals receiving i.v. sedation (exit time = 8.97 - 0.038 x age, SE = 3.6 min, p &lt; 0.0001). For patients receiving i.v. sedation, exit times were shorter as duration of surgery increased (exit time = 7.86 - 0.015 x duration of surgery, SE = 3.6 min, p &lt; 0.0002). Primary anesthetic drug did not affect exit times. CONCLUSION: Regional anesthesia and i.v. sedation were associated with faster OR exit times compared with general anesthesia. Despite desflurane's shorter elimination kinetics and recovery characteristics, use of this drug did not result in shorter exit times.<p>

We have previously reported that vitellogenin (Vg) of some female animals contained four polypeptides with molecular mass of 181, 115, 105 and 85 kDa, whereas Vg of most animals contained three polypeptides with molecular mass of 115, 105 and 85 kDa. In the present investigation, we examined whether the 181 kDa polypeptide is the precursor of 115 and 105 kDa Vg and vitellin (Vn) polypeptides. Labeling studies, using [35S]methionine on normal vitellogenic animals, showed that the radioactivity was distributed first among the 181 and 85 kDa polypeptides. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified hemolymph Vg from eyestalk ablated female animals revealed in most animals two polypeptides with an apparent molecular mass of 181 and 85 kDa. These results from in vivo experiments corroborated the view that the 115 and 105 kDa Vg and Vn polypeptides are derived from heaviest 181 kDa polypeptide. In addition it was demonstrated that hepatopancreas and ovary of Potamon potamios incubated in vitro with [35S]methionine synthesized five polypeptides with apparent molecular mass of 224, 181, 115, 105, and 85 kDa while the hepatopancreas appeared to secrete the 181, 115, 105 and 85 kDa polypeptides. The major 115, 105 and 85 kDa polypeptides were found to be components of egg Vn, while the 224 kDa polypeptide was found to be minor component of Vg and Vn from hepatopancreas and ovary extracts, respectively. We conclude that the Vn polypeptides produced by ovary are similar to those produced by hepatopancreas.<p>

Oxygen equilibrium curves and the relationships between the partial pressure of CO2 and pH were determined for the haemolymph of the arachnids Eurypelma californicum, Pandinus imperator and Cupiennius salei. A new type of experimental apparatus was constructed, tested and used to make these measurements on small undiluted cell-free haemolymph samples. Most of its components were made in our workshop and were inexpensive. The apparatus proved to be very reliable as demonstrated by control (oxygen concentration) experiments. In previous reports on O2 equilibrium curves of E. californicum haemocyanin, Tris&amp;shy;HCl buffer was used to set the pH, whereas in our experiments, pH was adjusted by altering the partial pressure of CO2. The O2 concentration measurements demonstrate an increase in oxygen affinity of E. californicum haemocyanin when using Tris&amp;shy;HCl buffer. The position and shape of the O2 equilibrium curves of E. californicum and P. imperator haemocyanin show a distinct dependency on pH. Oxygen affinity is lower in E. californicum and cooperativity changes with pH in E. californicum, but not in P. imperator. Oxygen transport in the haemolymph of E. californicum during rest, activity and recovery was calculated on the basis of the O2 equilibrium curves of undiluted haemolymph. Apart from oxygen transport, there are indications that haemocyanin is also involved in other physiological processes. For example, it may function as a storage protein.<p>

The ARE/poly-(U) binding factor 1 (AUF1), a protein family consisting of four isoforms, is believed to mediate mRNA degradation by binding to AU-rich elements (ARE). However, evidence exists that individual AUF1 isoforms may stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs. The 3'-untranslated region of the human inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) contains five AREs, which promote RNA degradation. We have recently shown that the RNA-binding protein KSRP is critically involved in the decay of the iNOS mRNA. In this study we examined the effects of the individual AUF1 isoforms on iNOS expression. Overexpression of each AUF1 isoform reduces iNOS expression on mRNA and protein levels to the same extent by modulation of mRNA stability. Accordingly, knockdown of all or individual AUF1 isoforms by an RNA interference approach enhances iNOS expression. The AUF1 effect on iNOS expression is dependent on the iNOS 3'-untranslated region sequence, as demonstrated in transfection experiments with a reporter mRNA. Binding studies showed that all AUF1 isoforms interact with the same AU-rich region in the iNOS-3'-untranslated region. Cytokine stimulation altered intracellular AUF1 binding activities. These data demonstrate that AUF1 is an important factor that promotes iNOS mRNA degradation. Furthermore, all individual AUF1 isoforms act in a similar manner.<p>

BACKGROUND: Complexity is a key problem when visualizing biological networks; as the number of entities increases, most graphical views become incomprehensible. Our goal is to enable many thousands of entities to be visualized meaningfully and with high performance. RESULTS: We present a new visualization tool, Arena3D, which introduces a new concept of staggered layers in 3D space. Related data--such as proteins, chemicals, or pathways--can be grouped onto separate layers and arranged via layout algorithms, such as Fruchterman-Reingold, distance geometry, and a novel hierarchical layout. Data on a layer can be clustered via k-means, affinity propagation, Markov clustering, neighbor joining, tree clustering, or UPGMA ('unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean'). A simple input format defines the name and URL for each node, and defines connections or similarity scores between pairs of nodes. The use of Arena3D is illustrated with datasets related to Huntington's disease. CONCLUSION: Arena3D is a user friendly visualization tool that is able to visualize biological or any other network in 3D space. It is free for academic use and runs on any platform. It can be downloaded or lunched directly from <A HREF="http://arena3d.org.">http://arena3d.org.</A> Java3D library and Java 1.5 need to be pre-installed for the software to run.<p>

Pavlopoulos, G. A., et al. (2008). &quot;A survey of visualization tools for biological network analysis.&quot; <u>Biodata Mining</u> <b>1</b>: 12.<p>
The analysis and interpretation of relationships between biological molecules, networks and concepts is becoming a major bottleneck in systems biology. Very often the pure amount of data and their heterogeneity provides a challenge for the visualization of the data. There are a wide variety of graph representations available, which most often map the data on 2D graphs to visualize biological interactions. These methods are applicable to a wide range of problems, nevertheless many of them reach a limit in terms of user friendliness when thousands of nodes and connections have to be analyzed and visualized. In this study we are reviewing visualization tools that are currently available for visualization of biological networks mainly invented in the latest past years. We comment on the functionality, the limitations and the specific strengths of these tools, and how these tools could be further developed in the direction of data integration and information sharing.<p>

Using psychophysical studies, the authors have evaluated the effectiveness of various strategies for compensating for physical degradations in SPECT imaging. The particular application was Ga-67-citrate imaging of mediastinal tumors, which was chosen because Ga-67 is a particularly challenging radionuclide for imaging. The test strategies included compensations for nonuniform attenuation, distance-dependent spatial resolution, and scatter applied in various combinations as part of iterative reconstructions with the rescaled block iterative-expectation maximization (RBI-EM) algorithm. The authors also evaluated filtered backprojection reconstructions. Strategies were compared on the basis of human-observer studies of lesion localization and detection accuracy using the localization receiver operating characteristics (LROC) paradigm. These studies involved hybrid images which were obtained by adding the projections of Monte Carlo-simulated lesions to disease-free clinical projection data. The background variability in these images can provide a more realistic assessment of the relative utility of reconstruction strategies than images from anthropomorphic digital phantoms. The clinical datasets were obtained using a GE-VG dual-detector SPECT system with CT-estimated attenuation maps. After determining a target lesion contrast, they conducted pilot LROC studies to obtain a near-optimal set of reconstruction parameters for each strategy, and then conducted the strategy comparison study. The results indicate improved detection accuracy with RBI-EM as more compensations are applied within the reconstruction. The relative rankings of the test strategies agreed in most cases with those of previous studies that employed simulated projections of digital anthropomorphic phantoms, thus confirming the findings of those studies.<p>

The APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases are part of the intrinsic defense of cells against retroviruses. Lentiviruses and spumaviruses have evolved essential accessory proteins, Vif and Bet, respectively, which counteract the APOBEC3 proteins. We show here that Bet of the Prototype foamy virus inhibits the antiviral APOBEC3C activity by a mechanism distinct to Vif: Bet forms a complex with APOBEC3C without inducing its degradation. Bet abolished APOBEC3C dimerization as shown by coimmunoprecipitation and cross-linking experiments. These findings implicate a physical interaction between Bet and the APOBEC3C. Subsequently, we identified the Bet interaction domain in human APOBEC3C in the predicted APOBEC3C dimerization site. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that Bet inhibits incorporation of APOBEC3Cs into retroviral particles. Bet likely achieves this by trapping APOBEC3C protein in complexes rendering them unavailable for newly generated viruses due to direct immobilization.<p>

The spider bites are quite frequent and often resolve quickly without leaving outcomes; only some species are capable of causing necrotic and systematic lesions in humans. Among them, we should mention the genus Loxosceles. The venom released from the spider bite of Loxosceles species is composed of proteins, enzymes, and nonenzymatic polypeptides. The phospholipase D family was identified as the active component of the venom. This family of enzymes is responsible for the local and systemic effects observed in loxoscelism. Phospholipases D interact with cell membranes triggering alterations which involve the complement system and activation of neutrophils and they cause the dermonecrotic skin lesions and systemic effects. We describe a fatal case of acute intoxication caused by a spider bite probably belonging to the species Loxosceles. The initial lesion was localized to a finger of a hand. Clinical course was worsening with deep necrotic lesions on limb, shock, hemolysis, acute kidney failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. All therapies were ineffective. This is the first fatal case described in Europe.<p>

Peptidoglycan is the major component of the bacterial cell wall and is involved in osmotic protection and in determining cell shape. Cell shape potentially influences many processes, including nutrient uptake as well as cell survival and growth. Peptidoglycan is a dynamic structure that changes during the growth cycle. Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis. Although PBPs are biochemically and physiologically well characterized, their broader effects, especially their effects on organismal fitness, are not well understood. In a long-term experiment, 12 populations of Escherichia coli having a common ancestor were allowed to evolve for more than 40,000 generations in a defined environment. We previously identified mutations in the pbpA operon in one-half of these populations; this operon encodes PBP2 and RodA proteins that are involved in cell wall elongation. In this study, we characterized the effects of two of these mutations on competitive fitness and other phenotypes. By constructing and performing competition experiments with strains that are isogenic except for the pbpA alleles, we showed that both mutations that evolved were beneficial in the environment used for the long-term experiment and that these mutations caused parallel phenotypic changes. In particular, they reduced the cellular concentration of PBP2, thereby generating spherical cells with an increased volume. In contrast to their fitness-enhancing effect in the environment where they evolved, both mutations decreased cellular resistance to osmotic stress. Moreover, one mutation reduced fitness during prolonged stationary phase. Therefore, alteration of the PBP2 concentration contributed to physiological trade-offs and ecological specialization during experimental evolution.<p>

BACKGROUND: Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiologic agent of a severe and fatal lymphoproliferative disease of mainly CD4+ T cell origin, adult T cell leukemia, which develops after prolonged viral persistence. Transformation of infected cells involves HTLV-1's oncoprotein Tax, which perturbs cell cycle regulation and modulates cellular gene expression. The latter function is also a hallmark of microRNAs, a rather new layer in the regulation of gene expression. Affecting e.g. proliferation, microRNAs constitute a potential target for viral interference on the way to persistence and transformation. Hence, we explored the interconnections between HTLV-1 and cellular microRNAs. RESULTS: We report that several microRNAs--miRs 21, 24, 146a, 155 and 223--are deregulated in HTLV-1-transformed cells. They are all upregulated except for miR-223, which is downregulated. Each of those microRNAs has ties to cancer. Their expression pattern forms a uniform phenotype among HTLV-transformed cells when compared to HTLV-negative control cells. In particular, miR-146a expression was found to be directly stimulated by Tax via NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of its promoter; a single NF-kappaB site proximal to the transcription start point was necessary and sufficient for this to happen. An in silico analysis of potential target genes revealed candidates that might be coregulated by two or more of the aforementioned overexpressed microRNAs. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that cellular microRNAs are deregulated in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. In the case of miR-146a, this could be directly attributed to HTLV's oncoprotein Tax. Interference with cellular microRNAs may be crucial to maintaining persistence or may facilitate transformation of host cells.<p>

Hexapods possess a tracheal system that enables the transport of oxygen to the inner organs. Although respiratory proteins have been considered unnecessary in most Hexapoda for this reason, we recently showed the presence of a functional hemocyanin in the stonefly Perla marginata. Here we report the identification and molecular characterization of a hemocyanin from Zygentoma (Thysanura). We obtained the full length cDNA of two distinct subunit types from the firebrat Thermobia domestica, and partial sequences of the orthologs from the silverfish Lepisma saccharina. The native T. domestica hemocyanin subunits both consist of 658 amino acids, but a signal peptide for transmembrane transport is missing in subunit 2. In adult firebrats both hemocyanin subunits represent a substantial proportion of the total hemolymph proteins. Phylogenetic analyses show that the subunit types are orthologous to subunits 1 and 2 of the stonefly Perla marginata. We further identified and sequenced a hexamerin subunit from T. domestica (689 amino acids), which suggests an early emergence of this type of proteins in hexapod evolution. In contrast to most other hexamerins, it does not reveal a high content in phenylalanine and tyrosine, which may be interpreted that the accumulation of aromatic amino acids commenced later in hexamerin evolution. Molecular clock calculations using hexamerins suggest that the divergence of Zygentoma and Pterygota occurred around 387 million years ago, which is in excellent agreement with the available fossil record.<p>

Pick, C., et al. (2009). &quot;The occurrence of hemocyanin in Hexapoda.&quot; <u>FEBS Journal</u> <b>276</b>(7): 1930-1941.<p>
Hemocyanins are copper-containing, respiratory proteins that have been thoroughly studied in various arthropod subphyla. Specific O(2)-transport proteins have long been considered unnecessary in Hexapoda (including Insecta), which acquire O(2) via an elaborate tracheal system. However, we recently identified a functional hemocyanin in the stonefly Perla marginata (Plecoptera) and in the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma). We used RT-PCR and RACE experiments to study the presence of hemocyanin in a broad range of ametabolous and hemimetabolous hexapod taxa. We obtained a total of 12 full-length and 5 partial cDNA sequences of hemocyanins from representatives of Collembola, Archeognatha, Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Mantodea, Isoptera and Blattaria. No hemocyanin could be identified in Protura, Diplura, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, or in the Eumetabola (Holometabola + Hemiptera). It is not currently known why hemocyanin has been lost in some taxa. Hexapod hemocyanins usually consist of two distinct subunit types. Whereas type 1 subunits may represent the central building block, type 2 subunits may be absent in some species. Phylogenetic analyses support the Pancrustacea hypothesis and show that type 1 and type 2 subunits diverged before the emergence of the Hexapoda. The copperless insect storage hexamerins evolved from hemocyanin type 1 subunits, with Machilis germanica (Archeognatha) hemocyanin being a possible 'intermediate'. The evolution of hemocyanin subunits follows the widely accepted phylogeny of the Hexapoda and provides strong evidence for the monophyly of the Polyneoptera (Plecoptera, Dermaptera, Orthoptera, Phasmatodea, Mantodea, Isoptera, Blattaria) and the Dictyoptera (Mantodea, Isoptera, Blattaria). The Blattaria are paraphyletic with respect to the termites.<p>

AIMS: This paper describes a case presentation of a process for using peer evaluation to identify and select new nursing leaders in hospital settings. BACKGROUND: A reliable method for identifying emerging leaders has yet to be defined. Often, it is based only on managerial observation and evaluation, and does not involve staff opinion. METHODS: We developed a three-tiered selection process consisting of: confidential peer voting, head nurse recommendations and a personal interview. RESULTS: Forty-three potential leaders were enrolled in our leadership training workshop. Twelve graduates of this workshop were chosen to fill leadership positions in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Peer recognition of potential nursing leaders might serve as a critical component in the process of selecting future nursing leaders. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Combining peer evaluation with structured leadership selection may be beneficial for the early recognition of future nursing leaders. This approach is not commonly used in the leader identification and selection process. It may contribute to a sense of trust between management and staff, and promote transparency as well as legitimacy in the selection process.<p>

In the Working Formulation (WF), non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are grouped according to their clinical behavior. These disorders are listed as entities defined by morphology, phenotype, and cytogenetics in the proposed Revised European-American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL), the clinical relevance of which is still debated. We analyzed 670 NHL cases included in two randomized clinical trials (EORTC 20855 WF-intermediate/high-grade and 20856 WF-low-grade malignancy) with histologic material available for review. Based on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, 77% of cases could be subtyped. Immunophenotyping was considered to be mandatory only in diagnosing T-cell lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Of 522 cases subtyped, 11% were mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 5% were marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (MZBCL), 46% were follicle center lymphoma, and 32% were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Statistical analysis and comparisons between classifications were made only within each trial and treatment group. MCL and MZBCL were characterized by a shorter median survival (3.4 and 4.1 years, respectively) in comparison with low- and intermediate-grade WF groups (&gt; 9.3 and 5.8 years, respectively). In terms of progression-free survival, MCL showed a behavior similar to the low-grade group, with frequent relapses. Follicle center cell lymphomas behaved as low-grade lymphomas as defined by the WF and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas as the WF-intermediate grade group. Because several NHL entities have a clinical behavior of their own, their recognition by the REAL classification offers clinicians additional information that is not obtained when the WF is used.<p>

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive loss of motoneurons, motor weakness and death within 1-5 years after disease onset. Therapeutic options remain limited despite a substantial number of approaches that have been tested clinically. In particular, various neurotrophic factors have been investigated. Failure in these trials has been largely ascribed to problems of insufficient dosing or inability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We have recently uncovered the neurotrophic properties of the haematopoietic protein granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). The protein is clinically well tolerated and crosses the intact BBB. This study examined the potential role of G-CSF in motoneuron diseases. We investigated the expression of the G-CSF receptor in motoneurons and studied effects of G-CSF in a motoneuron cell line and in the SOD1(G93A) transgenic mouse model. The neurotrophic growth factor was applied both by continuous subcutaneous delivery and CNS-targeted transgenic overexpression. This study shows that given at the stage of the disease where muscle denervation is already evident, G-CSF leads to significant improvement in motor performance, delays the onset of severe motor impairment and prolongs overall survival of SOD1(G93A)tg mice. The G-CSF receptor is expressed by motoneurons and G-CSF protects cultured motoneuronal cells from apoptosis. In ALS mice, G-CSF increased survival of motoneurons and decreased muscular denervation atrophy. We conclude that G-CSF is a novel neurotrophic factor for motoneurons that is an attractive and feasible drug candidate for the treatment of ALS.<p>

We investigated whether captopril is able to potentiate vasodilation and prevent tolerance to a 48-hour infusion of nitroglycerin (NTG). Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to a 7-day regimen of captopril (50 mg/day) or placebo. The hemodynamic response to a 0.8 mg sublingual NTG dose was assessed by measuring mean arterial pressure (MAP), mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), right atrial pressure (RAP), and cardiac output (CO), and calculating systemic (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR). The parameters were obtained serially at baseline and 1 to 10 minutes after the sublingual NTG application (day 1). Then intravenous NTG was started and maintained for 48 hours (1.5 micrograms/kg/min), and the hemodynamic study was repeated (day 3). There was no difference between the captopril and the placebo groups at day 1 (baseline values and response to sublingual NTG). After the 48-hour infusion, there was a complete loss of the NTG effects in the placebo group (day 1 vs day 3: PAP, 20 +/- 5 mm Hg vs 21 +/- 8 mm Hg; MAP, 86 +/- 11 mm Hg vs 90 +/- 9 mm Hg; SVR, 1295 +/- 330 mm Hg vs 1380 +/- 465 dyne.sec.cm-5) whereas there was still evidence of a persistent vasodilation in the captopril group (day 1 vs day 3: PAP, 19 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 13 +/- 4 mm Hg; MAP, 84 +/- 9 mm Hg vs 74 +/- 10 mm Hg; SVR, 1265 +/- 280 mm Hg vs 1140 +/- 425 dyne.sec.cm-5). The response to sublingual NTG on day 3 was markedly attenuated in the placebo group only. We conclude that captopril does not increase the vasodilatory response to nitroglycerin but is able to prevent developing nitrate tolerance in arterial and venous circulation.<p>

UNLABELLED: It is still a matter of dispute to what extent a direct loss of nitrate mediated vasodilatation (true tolerance) contributes to the development of nitrate tolerance. Aim of this study was to assess to what extent the dilatation of non-obstructed segments of epicardial arteries is attenuated during a continuous 24- and 48-h-infusion of nitroglycerin. In a prospective, randomized and blinded study we investigated 32 patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. All cardiac medication was withdrawn at least for 24 h; patients were randomized to either a 24 h NTG-infusion (group A; 0-24 h saline infusion followed by a 24 h NTG-infusion; n = 16) or a 48 h NTG-infusion (group B; 0-48 h of NTG-infusion; n = 16) in a dosage of 1.5 micrograms/ kg/min. The patients were included if 5 proximal segments of the left coronary artery showed no visible atherosclerosis. A coronary angiography was performed after 24 and 48 h respectively. The lumen diameters were measured by quantitative coronary analysis at baseline and 1 and 3 min after application of 0.2 mg of NTG intracoronarially (i.c.). Blood samples were drawn before and after 24 and 48 h of infusions to measure hematocrit and neurohormones. In group A after 24 h of saline infusion there was a significant increase in lumen diameter from 3.14 +/- 0.17 mm at baseline to 3.51 +/- 0.11 mm (p &lt; 0.001) and 3.60 +/- 0.21 mm (p &lt; 0.001) after 1 and 3 min of NTG i.e. respectively. After 24 h of NTG-infusion there were no significant changes in baseline and values after further NTG i.e. In group B after 24 h of NTG-infusion no significant change in lumen diameter was detectable after NTG i.e. (3.57 +/- 0.23 mm to 3.63 +/- 0.13 mm) and the mean diameter remained unchanged after prolongation of NTG to 48 h (3.58 +/- 0.33 mm). There were no significant differences between the baseline values and the responses to i.e. NTG after 24 and 48 h of NTG infusion. Hematocrit and aldosterone levels decreased significantly after NTG-infusion but not following saline. Renin and norepinephrine remained unchanged throughout the NTG-infusion-periods. IN CONCLUSION: The vasodilatation of non-obstructed segments of epicardial arteries persists during a prolonged infusion period and there is no induction of vascular tolerance between the 24 and 48 h infusion period.

Ploemen, J. H., et al. (1994). &quot;Active-site tyrosyl residues are targets in the irreversible inhibition of a class Mu glutathione transferase by 2-(S-glutathionyl)-3,5,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone.&quot; <u>Journal of Biological Chemistry</u> <b>269</b>(43): 26890-26897.<p>
The mode of inactivation of glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme 3-3 from rat by the active site-directed inhibitor 2-(S-glutathionyl)-3,5,6-trichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (GSTCBQ) has been investigated by a combination of site-specific mutagenesis and mass spectrometric analysis of the sites of reaction of the reagent with the enzyme. This very reactive reagent is shown to target 3 residues in or near the active site, including the hydroxyl groups of Tyr-6 and Tyr-115 and the sulfhydryl group of Cys-114. Although the covalent attachment of one 2-(S-glutathionyl)dichloro-1,4-benzoquinonyl group/active site is sufficient to inactivate the enzyme ( &lt; 5% residual activity), the 1 mol of reagent appears to be distributed among all three target sites. Mutant enzymes in which the reactive functional groups of these 3 residues have been individually removed remain susceptible to GSTCBQ. Evidence from amino acid sequencing and peptide maps visualized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry suggests that both Tyr-6 and Tyr-115 are primary targets of the reagent in the native enzyme. Docking of a model of GSTCBQ in a model of the active site derived from the crystal structure of the enzyme indicates that the trichlorobenzoquinonyl group can be positioned so that both tyrosine hydroxyl groups can act as nucleophiles to add to the reagent or alternatively act as electrophiles to assist in the nucleophilic addition of the other. The reaction of GSTCBQ with Cys-114 appears to require a conformation different from that in the crystal structure.<p>

Pruritus (itch) is an unpleasant sensation inducing the desire to scratch. Chronic pruritus (&gt;6 weeks' duration) is a major and distressing symptom of many diseases of dermatological, systemic, neurological or psychogenic origin. Frequently, the underlying cause of pruritus cannot be identified and causal therapy is not possible. Furthermore, chronic pruritus is frequently refractory to conventional symptomatic therapies. Recent research has revealed new neuronal mechanisms in the skin and brain, suggesting novel therapeutic targets. The efficacy of the corresponding innovative therapies has been proven in recent studies and case series. For example, topical or systemic application of specific agonists such as cannabinoids or calcineurin inhibitors can influence neuroreceptors on sensory nerve fibers of the skin and suppress pruritus. Itch-selective neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord can be targeted to inhibit the transmission of pruritus to the somatosensory cortex. Anticonvulsants, antidepressants and micro-opioid receptor antagonists interfere with the sensation of pruritus in the central nervous system. Chronic pruritus of any origin leads to considerable psychosocial burden and impairs quality of life. Psychoeducational interventions, stress training, training in social competence and relaxation techniques are therefore important elements in the treatment of chronic pruritus. Increasing knowledge of the neurobiology of chronic pruritus offers new therapeutic strategies. Currently, several clinical trials are investigating the efficacy of new substances addressing neuroreceptors and cytokines in the skin and central nervous system. The present review aims to provide an overview of current neurophysiological and neurochemical therapeutic models in chronic pruritus.<p>

Lyme borreliosis is currently the most frequent tick-transmitted zoonosis in the northern hemisphere. Germany and other European countries are regarded as highly endemic areas; therefore the burden of disease and consequently the costs for the health systems are considered to be high. This report summarises the results of an interdisciplinary workshop on Lyme borreliosis which aimed to identify research deficits and to prioritise areas which need to be addressed. Research needs have been recognised for different areas: diagnosis, epidemiology, immunology, clinics, ecology and health services research. Examples of research areas which have priority are the standardisation of diagnostic tests, the development of markers to detect an active infection, the improvement of the epidemiological database and the analysis of the burden of disease.<p>

The aeromedical research and operational flying communities have at least one common goal; ensuring the optimum combination of mission performance and safety for the aircrew. This is a continual challenge as aerospace technology leaps ahead while the human factor remains relatively constant. However, several issues interfere with the smooth interaction between these communities: 1) perceptions that the research and operational communities have towards human subjects and pilots respectively; 2) the legal and ethical considerations involved in exposing individuals to risk; and 3) the ever-present personality dynamics involved in any decision-making process (e.g., returning individuals to a centrifuge panel or flying duty after a medically disqualifying incident). All of these factors influence decisions made in both communities, and how they interact with each other. It is a dynamic process that varies between countries, individual services (e.g., Navy vs Air Force), and even between different geographical locations within the same service.<p>

A rapid direct-extraction method was used to obtain DNA from environmental soil samples. Heat, enzymes, and guanidine isothiocyanate were utilized to lyse cells. The DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, amplified with 16S rRNA-based primers by use of the polymerase chain reaction, and then digested with the restriction endonuclease PalI. The extraction method was used to obtain DNA from a variety of plants, bacteria, and fungi including Gossypium hirsucum (cotton), Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Streptomyces, and Colletotrichum. Up to 100 micrograms DNA/g (wet weight) of soil and 400 micrograms DNA/g of plant material were recovered. Restriction endonuclease analysis patterns of amplified rDNA from pure microbial cultures and plant species contained three to five different DNA fragments. Amplified rDNA of mixed population DNA extracts from soil samples, digested with the restriction endonuclease PalI, contained 12-20 DNA fragments, appearing as sample &quot;fingerprints.&quot; Results from eight environmental soil samples that were analyzed suggest that the amplified rDNA fingerprints can be used to help characterize the genetic and biological diversity of the microbial populations in these samples.<p>

A 40-year-old Turkish man on busulphan treatment for chronic myeloid leukaemia was hospitalized with steroid resistant (up to 100 mg prednisolone/24 h for over 4 weeks) colitis. On the basis of concomitant orogenital ulceration and unusual, deep punched out ulcers in the colon and smaller ulcers in the terminal ileum, Behcet's disease of the bowel, manifesting as ileocolitis, was diagnosed. Leukaemic infiltration, Crohn's colitis, neutropenic colitis and infectious colitis were excluded by histology and cultures. Treatment with colchicine 2 mg/day improved the orogenital ulcers but with only minor improvement of the colitis. Thalidomide treatment (400 mg/day), however, dramatically improved the colitis within 7 days: fever and diarrhoea disappearing. Colonoscopy after 4 weeks of treatment revealed previously giant ulcers practically healed.<p>

Polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (PCR/ESI-MS, previously known as &quot;TIGER&quot;) utilizes PCR with broad-range primers to amplify products from a wide array of organisms within a taxonomic group, followed by analysis of PCR amplicons using mass spectrometry. Computer analysis of precise masses allows for calculations of base compositions for the broad-range PCR products, which can then be compared to a database for identification. PCR/ESI-MS has the benefits of PCR in sensitivity and high-throughput capacity, but also has the distinct advantage of being able to detect and identify organisms with no prior characterization or sequence data. Existing broad range PCR primers, designed with an emphasis on human pathogens, were tested for their ability to amplify DNA of well characterized phytobacterial strains, as well as to populate the existing PCR/ESI-MS bacterial database with base counts. In a blinded panel study, PCR/ESI-MS successfully identified 93% of unknown bacterial DNAs to the genus level and 73% to the species/subspecies level. Additionally, PCR/ESI-MS was capable of detecting and identifying multiple bacteria within the same sample. The sensitivity of PCR/ESI-MS was consistent with other PCR based assays, and the specificity varied depending on the bacterial species. Preliminary tests with real life samples demonstrate a high potential for using PCR/ESI-MS systems for agricultural diagnostic applications.<p>

We investigated the role of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) on the ovarian maturation and protein levels and pattern in adult females of the spider Tegenaria atrica. In unmated females, the ovaries did not initiate vitellogenesis and levels of proteins in the hemolymph and ovaries were low. Unmated females treated with 20E showed an increase in the total amount of proteins in their hemolymph and ovaries, comparable with that in untreated mated females. Vitellogenesis was observable histologically in 20E treated unmated females as in untreated mated ones. The electrophoretic analysis of total proteins revealed a 47 kDa band expressed in the vitellogenic ovaries and hemolymph of 20E treated unmated females and untreated mated ones as in newly laid eggs. We hypothesize that this 47 kDa protein could belong to the vitellogenin-vitellin complex. We describe in this paper, for the first time in a spider, the partial characterization of putative yolk protein.<p>

The objectives of this study were to examine the response, repeatability, and injury predictive ability of the Hybrid III small-female dummy to static out-of-position (OOP) deployments using a depowered driver-side airbag. Five dummy tests were conducted in two OOP configurations by two different laboratories. The OOP configurations were nose-on-rim (NOR) and chest-on-bag (COB). Four cadaver tests were conducted using unembalmed small-female cadavers and the same airbags used in the dummy tests under similar OOP conditions. One cadaver test was designed to increase airbag loading of the face and neck (a forehead-on-rim, or FOR test). Comparison between the dummy tests of Lab 1 and of Lab 2 indicated the test conditions and results were repeatable. In the cadaver tests no skull fractures or neck injuries occurred. However, all four cadavers had multiple rib fractures. These results suggested that an older, osteoporatic, small-female driver would experience AIS &gt; or = 3 thoracic injury if exposed to this type of depowered airbag inflation for the three positions tested, but would be unlikely to experience any head or neck injury. The cadaver results provided no information about the possibility of AIS &gt; or = 3 rib fractures for the average small, female driver. The Hybrid III small-female dummy results suggest that a low percentage (15%) of small, female drivers would experience AIS &gt; or = 3 thoracic injuries if they had their chest on the module cover at the time of deployment of this depowered airbag. Also, for this position, the dummy results indicated a risk of an AIS = 2 neck injury for some small, female drivers. For all positions tested, the dummy results predicted that head injury was unlikely for most small-female drivers.<p>

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), a monoamine neurotransmitter of the central nervous and peripheral systems (CNS), plays a critical role in a wide variety of physiological and behavioral processes. In the serotonergic system, deregulation of the tightly controlled extracellular concentration of 5-HT appears to be at the origin of a host of metabolic and psychiatric disorders. A key step that regulates 5-HT external level is the re-uptake of 5-HT into cells by the 5-HT transporter (SERT), which is besides the target of numerous drugs interacting with the serotonergic system. Therapeutic strategies have mainly focused on the development of compounds that block the activity of SERT, for instance reuptake inhibitors (e.g. tricyclics, &quot;selective&quot; serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and in the past, specific substrate-type releasers (e.g. amphetamine and cocaine derivatives). Today, generation of new drugs targetting SERT with enhanced selectivity and reduced toxicity is one of the most challenging tasks in drug design. In this context, studies aiming at characterizing the physicochemical properties of 5-HT as well as the biological active conformation of SERT are a prerequisite to the design of new leads. However, the absence of a high-resolution 3D-structure for SERT has hampered the design of new transporter inhibitors. Using computational approaches, numerous efforts were made to shed light on the structure of 5-HT and its transporter. In this review, we compared several in silico methods dedicated to the modeling of 5-HT and SERT with an emphasis on i) quantum chemistry for study of 5-HT conformation and ii) ligand-based (QSAR and pharmacophore models) and transporter-based (homology models) approaches for studying SERT molecule. In addition, we discuss some methodological aspects of the computational work in connection with the construction of putative but reliable 3D structural models of SERT that may help to predict the mechanisms of neurotransmitter transport.<p>

Bryden et al. expose some of the principal weaknesses of the cerebral lateralization model put forth by Geschwind and colleagues and contribute an important meta-analysis of findings concerning the model's predicted relationship between immune disorders and handedness. Nonetheless, the theory put forth by Geschwind and colleagues retains an important legacy despite a multitude of faulty assumptions and predictive failures. Also offered is a brief synopsis of a new model that explains the many positive relationships found among various neurodevelopmental disorders and medical conditions, as well as why abnormal handedness distributions occur in some but not other neurodevelopmental disorders.<p>

Previous data suggest that vertical imbalances between the eyes produced by lateral head tilt are linked to ocular dominance, but no studies have heretofore objectively measured head tilt in addressing this relationship. Photographic measurements of the head tilt of 70 subjects were made, along with measures of sighting dominance and vertical misalignment during sighting. The analyses revealed that photographically measured head tilt is significantly associated with vertical imbalances during sighting and with sighting dominance. These data support the theory that motoric dominance in humans is partly related to mechanisms underlying postural asymmetry.<p>

Abstract Third-instar larvae of the goldenrod gall fly Eurosta solidaginis (Diptera: Tephritidae) are freeze tolerant in winter. During freezing, cell membranes must compensate for both low temperature and partial dehydration. Documented adaptations to low temperature include increased fatty acid unsaturation and enrichment of cone-shaped phosphatides, both of which inhibit formation of gel phase lipid domains. These changes appear inconsistent with adaptations known to prevent formation of the hexagonal II phospholipid phase at low water activities, namely, increased fatty acid saturation and increased proportions of cylindrical phosphatides. To address these inconsistencies, changes in E. solidaginis phospholipid composition and class-specific fatty acid composition were studied from August to November 2002. Cylindrical phosphatides, mostly phosphatidylcholine (PC), increased transiently and significantly, from 35% of the total to nearly 50%, during the transition from freeze susceptible to freeze tolerant. Monoenes in both PC and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) represented 35% of total fatty acids in freeze-susceptible larvae but accumulated in PC to 48% and in PE to 42% in freeze-tolerant larvae. Moreover, PC accumulated the most unsaturated acid in this species, 18:3(n-3), to a significantly greater degree than PE. This combination of changes may represent a finely tailored response to both low temperatures and freeze-induced dehydration.<p>

All mitochondria have integral outer membrane proteins with beta-barrel structures including the conserved metabolite transporter VDAC (voltage dependent anion channel) and the conserved protein import channel Tom40. Bioinformatic searches of the Trypanosoma brucei genome for either VDAC or Tom40 identified a single open reading frame, with sequence analysis suggesting that VDACs and Tom40s are ancestrally related and should be grouped into the same protein family: the mitochondrial porins. The single T. brucei mitochondrial porin is essential only under growth conditions that depend on oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria isolated from homozygous knockout cells did not produce adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) in response to added substrates, but ATP production was restored by physical disruption of the outer membrane. These results demonstrate that the mitochondrial porin identified in T. brucei is the main metabolite channel in the outer membrane and therefore the functional orthologue of VDAC. No distinct Tom40 was identified in T. brucei. In addition to mitochondrial proteins, T. brucei imports all mitochondrial tRNAs from the cytosol. Isolated mitochondria from the VDAC knockout cells import tRNA as efficiently as wild-type. Thus, unlike the scenario in plants, VDAC is not required for mitochondrial tRNA import in T. brucei.<p>

alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) is a main component of Lewy bodies (LB) that occur in many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with LB (DLB) and multi-system atrophy. alpha-syn mutations or amplifications are responsible for a subset of autosomal dominant familial PD cases, and overexpression causes neurodegeneration and motor disturbances in animals. To investigate mechanisms for alpha-syn accumulation and toxicity, we studied a mouse model of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D (CD) deficiency, and found extensive accumulation of endogenous alpha-syn in neurons without overabundance of alpha-syn mRNA. In addition to impaired macroautophagy, CD deficiency reduced proteasome activity, suggesting an essential role for lysosomal CD function in regulating multiple proteolytic pathways that are important for alpha-syn metabolism. Conversely, CD overexpression reduces alpha-syn aggregation and is neuroprotective against alpha-syn overexpression-induced cell death in vitro. In a C. elegans model, CD deficiency exacerbates alpha-syn accumulation while its overexpression is protective against alpha-syn-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Mutated CD with diminished enzymatic activity or overexpression of cathepsins B (CB) or L (CL) is not protective in the worm model, indicating a unique requirement for enzymatically active CD. Our data identify a conserved CD function in alpha-syn degradation and identify CD as a novel target for LB disease therapeutics.<p>

The structure and thermotropic phase behaviour of aqueous dispersions of egg phosphatidylcholine, egg sphingomyelin, bovine brain sphingomyelin and binary mixtures of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelins have been examined by synchrotron X-ray diffraction methods. Small-angle lamellar Bragg peaks and wide-angle X-ray scattering bands have been subjected to peak fitting procedures to identify coexisting gel and fluid as well as fluid-fluid bilayer structures. Molecular species of egg phosphatidylcholine exhibit fluid-fluid immiscibility throughout heating scans from 20 degrees to 50 degrees C. Egg and brain sphingomyelins exhibit gel-fluid bilayer coexistence at temperatures below the main phase transition temperature and fluid-fluid phase coexistence at higher temperatures. Binary mixtures of equimolar proportions of egg phosphatidylcholine and either of the sphingomyelins show gel-fluid phase coexistence at temperatures below the gel phase transition temperature of the respective sphingomyelin. Binary mixtures containing egg sphingomyelin show fluid-fluid immiscibility at all temperatures of the heating scans whereas the fluid phase of mixtures comprising brain sphingomyelin are apparently miscible at all temperatures. An analysis of binary mixtures containing egg sphingomyelin and egg phosphatidylcholine in molar ratios 50:50, 67:33 and 83:17 at 50 degrees C to identify the composition of the lamellar phases indicated that the two phospholipids are immiscible in bilayers in the fluid phase. The results are discussed in terms of the role of intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrocarbon chain composition of sphingomyelins in maintaining coupling across fluid bilayers.<p>

Quinn, P. J. and C. Wolf (2009). &quot;The liquid-ordered phase in membranes.&quot; <u>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</u> <b>1788</b>(1): 33-46.<p>
A range of physiological processes has been imputed to lateral domain formation in biological membranes. However the molecular mechanisms of these functions and the details of how domain structures mediate these processes remain largely speculative. That domains exist in biomembranes and can be modeled in relatively simple lipid systems has contributed to our understanding of the principles governing phase behaviour in membranes. A presentation of these principles is the subject of this review. The condensing effect of sterols on phospholipids spread as monomolecular films at the air-water interface is described in terms of the dependence of the effect on sterol and phospholipid structure. The thermodynamics of sphingomyelin-cholesterol interactions are considered from calorimetric, densitometry and equilibrium cholesterol exchange measurements. Biophysical characterisation of the structure of liquid-ordered phase and its relationship with liquid-disordered phase is described from spectroscopic and X-ray scattering studies. Finally, the properties of liquid-ordered phase in the context of membrane physiology and permeability barrier properties are considered.<p>

The Bragg reflections observed in the small-angle scattering region from pure phospholipids and codispersions of sphingomyelin:cholesterol in molar ratios 80:20 and 50:50 could all be deconvolved using peak fitting methods into two coexisting lamellar structures. Electron density profiles through the unit cell normal to the bilayer plane were calculated to derive bilayer and water layer thicknesses of coexisting structures at 20 degrees and 50 degrees Celsius. Codispersions of sphingomyelin:cholesterol in a molar ratio 60:40 consisted of an apparently homogeneous bilayer structure designated as liquid-ordered phase. Curve fitting analysis of the wide-angle scattering bands were applied to correlate changes in packing arrangements of hydrocarbon in the hydrophobic domain of the bilayer with changes in enthalpy recorded by differential scanning calorimetry. At 20 degrees Celsius the wide-angle scattering bands of both pure sphingomyelins and codispersions of sphingomyelin and cholesterol could be deconvolved into two symmetric components. A sharp component located at a d-spacing of 0.42 nm was assigned to a gel phase in which the hydrocarbon chains are oriented perpendicular to the bilayer plane. A broader symmetric band centered at d-spacings in the region of 0.44 nm was assigned as disordered hydrocarbon in dispersions of pure sphingomyelin and as liquid-ordered phase in codispersions of sphingomyelin and cholesterol. It is concluded from the peak fitting analysis that cholesterol is excluded from gel phases of egg and brain sphingomyelins at 20 degrees Celsius. The gel phases coexist with liquid-ordered phase comprised of egg-sphingomyelin and 27 mol% cholesterol and brain-sphingomyelin and 33 mol% cholesterol, respectively. Correlation of the disappearance of gel phase during heating scans and the enthalpy change recorded by calorimetry in codispersions of sphingomyelin and cholesterol leads to the conclusion that a major contribution to the broadened phase transition endotherm originates from dilution of the cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered phase by mobilization of sphingomyelin from the melting gel phase.<p>

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in Luxembourg, with a marked seasonal peak during summer. The majority of these infections are thought to be sporadic, and the relative contribution of potential sources and reservoirs is still poorly understood. We monitored human cases from June to September 2006 (n = 124) by molecular characterization of isolates with the aim of rapidly detecting temporally related cases. In addition, isolates from poultry meat (n = 36) and cattle cecal contents (n = 48) were genotyped for comparison and identification of common clusters between veterinary and human C. jejuni populations. A total of 208 isolates were typed by sequencing the fla short variable region, macrorestriction analysis resolved by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). We observed a high diversity of human strains during a given summer season. Poultry and human isolates had a higher diversity of sequence types than isolates of bovine origin, for which clonal complexes CC21 (41.6%) and CC61 (18.7%) were predominant. CC21 was also the most common complex found among human isolates (21.8%). The substantial concordance between PFGE and MLST results for this last group of strains suggests that they are clonally related. Our study indicates that while poultry remains an important source, cattle could be an underestimated reservoir of human C. jejuni cases. Transmission mechanisms of cattle-specific strains warrant further investigation.<p>

An immunologically anomalous LH with two point mutations in its beta-subunit gene (Trp8Arg and Ile15Thr) has recently been described. This polymorphism is common in Finland; 28% of the population are homo- or heterozygous for the variant allele. To assess the effect of the LH variant on LH action, we correlated its presence in a group of 49 healthy boys with the onset and progression of puberty. This group was followed-up longitudinally from a mean age of 11.7 +/- 0.1 yr for 3 yr at 3-month intervals. In addition, we studied the prevalence of the variant LH in boys with constitutional pubertal delay (testicular volume &lt; or = 4 mL after 13.5 yr of age). The LH beta gene status of each subject in this study was judged from a single venous blood sample using two immunofluorometric LH assays with different combinations of monoclonal antibodies: one detecting both the variant and wild-type LH, and the other detecting only wild-type hormone. Of the boys with pubertal onset at a normal age, 36 (74%) were homozygous for the wild-type LH beta allele, 12 (24%) were heterozygous, and 1 (2%) was homozygous for the variant LH beta allele. Clear differences in pubertal parameters were found between the boys with normal and mutated (homo- or heterozygous) LH genotypes. During the follow-up, the boys with the mutated genotype had smaller testicular volumes (P &lt; 0.03), were shorter (P &lt; 0.02), had slower growth rates (P &lt; 0.04), and had lower serum insulin-like growth factor I-binding protein-3 levels (P &lt; 0.03) than the boys with the normal LH genotype. In the boys with delayed onset of puberty, the frequency of the variant LH beta allele did not differ from that in the reference population, indicating that the variant LH is not associated with conditions due to disturbed control of the reactivation of GnRH secretion. We conclude that during the progression of puberty, the variant LH may be less active in stimulating testicular growth than wild-type LH. Thus, the gene may affect tempo, contributing to the wide normal variation in pubertal progression in healthy boys. Our results also suggest that the variant LH not only affects the course of puberty, but is already involved in the regulation of the GH-insulin-like growth factor I axis during childhood.<p>

The epithelium of the murine vagina contains a resident population of gamma delta T-cells that expresses a homogenous Vgamma4/Vdelta1 TCR lacking N-region junctional diversity, implying that these T-cells recognize a very limited array of antigenic structures. The vaginal gamma delta T-cells express a pattern of surface markers characteristic of memory/effector T-cells that have previously been activated. Although vaginal gamma delta T-cells do not express the major costimulatory molecules CD28 and CD2, they do proliferate in response to a systemically delivered anti gamma delta TCR stimulus. Vaginal gamma delta T-cells contain mRNA that encodes the keratinocyte growth factor raising the possibility that these cells play a role in the repair of vaginal epithelium following injury. While the antigen recognized by the vaginal gamma delta TCR is unknown, a model is proposed which attempts to relate some of the unusual phenotypic features of vaginal gamma delta T-cells to the physiological injury and shedding of vaginal epithelium that occurs during the estrous cycle.<p>

Fracture-dislocations of the tarsometatarsal (Lisfranc) joints are frequently overlooked or misdiagnosed at initial presentation. This is a comparative cohort study over a period of five years comparing primary open reduction and internal fixation in 22 patients (23 feet) with secondary corrective arthrodesis in 22 patients (22 feet) who presented with painful malunion at a mean of 22 months (1.5 to 45) after injury. In the first group primary treatment by open reduction and internal fixation for eight weeks with Kirschner-wires or screws was undertaken, in the second group treatment was by secondary corrective arthrodesis. There was one deep infection in the first group. In the delayed group there was one complete and one partial nonunion. In each group 20 patients were available for follow-up at a mean of 36 months (24 to 89) after operation. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society midfoot score was 81.4 (62 to 100) after primary treatment and 71.8 (35 to 88) after corrective arthrodesis (t-test; p = 0.031). We conclude that primary treatment by open reduction and internal fixation of tarsometatarsal fracture-dislocations leads to improved functional results, earlier return to work and greater patient satisfaction than secondary corrective arthrodesis, which remains a useful salvage procedure providing significant relief of pain and improvement in function.<p>

Planners advocate best management practices (BMPs) to reduce loss of sediment and nutrients in agricultural areas. However, the scientific community lacks tools that use readily available data to investigate the relationships between BMPs and their spatial locations and water quality. In rural, humid regions where runoff is associated with saturation-excess processes from variable source areas (VSAs), BMPs are potentially most effective when they are located in areas that produce the majority of the runoff. Thus, two critical elements necessary to predict the water quality impact of BMPs include correct identification of VSAs and accurate predictions of nutrient reduction due to particular BMPs. The objective of this research was to determine the effectiveness of BMPs using the Variable Source Loading Function (VSLF) model, which captures the spatial and temporal evolutions of VSAs in the landscape. Data from a long-term monitoring campaign on a 164-ha farm in the New York City source watersheds in the Catskills Mountains of New York state were used to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of BMPs. The data spanned an 11-year period over which a suite of BMPs, including a nutrient management plan, riparian buffers, filter strips and fencing, was installed to reduce phosphorus (P) loading. Despite its simplicity, VSLF predicted the spatial distribution of runoff producing areas well. Dissolved P reductions were simulated well by using calibrated reduction factors for various BMPs in the VSLF model. Total P losses decreased only after cattle crossings were installed in the creek. The results demonstrated that BMPs, when sited with respect to VSAs, reduce P loss from agricultural watersheds, providing useful information for targeted water quality management.<p>

Doxorubicin and camptothecin are two cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents triggering apoptosis in various cancer cells, including thyroid carcinoma cells. Recent studies revealed a critical role of ceramide in chemotherapy and suggested that anti-cancer drugs may kill tumor cells through sphingomyelinase activation. However, in comparison to sphingomyelin hydrolysis, the relative involvement of de novo ceramide synthesis remained poorly explored and highly controversial. Here, we evidenced that both doxorubicin and camptothecin triggered ceramide accumulation in thyroid carcinoma cells. We demonstrated that ceramide increase occurred via the de novo pathway without neither acidic nor neutral sphingomyelinase contribution. Interestingly, de novo ceramide generation was responsible for the drug-induced malignant cell apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway and a decrease of thrombospondin amount. Furthermore, blocking ceramide metabolism by inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase strengthened the camptothecin and doxorubicin-dependent effects. Altogether, we evidenced that de novo ceramide synthesis mediates the anti-tumor properties of doxorubicin and camptothecin in thyroid carcinoma and suggested that glucosylation of ceramide may contribute to the drug-resistance phenotype in thyroid malignancies.<p>

By the end of oocyte development, the ovaries of Penaeus semisulcatus have accumulated almost equal amounts (approximately 16 mg lipid g-1 protein) of phospholipids and triacylglycerols. The phospholipids consist mainly of phosphatidylcholine (75-80 %) and phosphatidylethanolamine (20-25 %). Approximately 30 % of the total fatty acid content of both phospholipids and triacylglycerols is made up of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In fractions obtained by centrifugation of ovarian homogenates, most of the increase in levels of ovarian lipids during ovarian maturation was associated with an increase in triacylglycerol levels in the floating fat fraction and of phospholipids in the infranatant fraction. The presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the ovaries indicates the occurrence of lipid transport to the ovary during oocyte maturation. The gradual decrease in the relative abundance of polyunsaturated fatty acids as the ovaries matured supports previously published results suggesting intra-ovarian synthesis of saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids. Most of the lipids found in the female haemolymph (64.8 %) were recovered in the high-density lipoprotein fraction after density ultracentrifugation. The haemocyanin fraction recovered from this stage of fractionation contained substantial amounts of lipid (16.8 %) that could be removed by further sequential centrifugation at a higher NaBr density, leaving less than 0.9 % of the total haemolymph lipids associated with this fraction. While 16.2 % of the lipids were recovered from the very high-density lipoprotein fractions, these lipoproteins carried only 64-89 microg lipid mg-1 protein compared with 538.9 microg lipid mg-1 protein in the high-density lipoprotein fraction, indicating that the high-density lipoproteins are more likely to be the main transporters of lipids to the ovary. However, the contribution of very high-density lipoproteins to lipid transport cannot be ruled out at this stage. In this study, we present two models for lipid transport to the ovary based on the abundance of phospholipids and triacylglycerols in the haemolymph and on the amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulated within the ovary during vitellogenesis.<p>

There is emerging evidence in schizophrenia of membrane abnormalities, primarily reductions in the essential omega-3 and omega-6 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Because previous studies have largely been in chronic patients, it is not known whether these membrane abnormalities also occur early in illness. In the present study, red blood cell membrane fatty acid levels were determined by capillary gas chromatography from 24 neuroleptic-naive patients with first episode schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 31 age-matched normal controls. Relative to normal subjects, patients had significant reductions in total PUFA (-13%) but not in monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. Specifically, significant reductions were found in arachidonic acid (-18%), docosapentaenoic acid (-36%), and docosahexaenoic acid (-26%) concentrations. These reductions were not related to age, gender, smoking status, or cotinine levels. These results confirm previous findings of membrane deficits in schizophrenia and show that significant PUFA reductions occur early in the illness, prior to initiation of treatment, raising the possibility that these deficits are trait related. The findings also suggest that membrane fatty acid losses are quite specific to the highly unsaturated fatty acids.<p>

Rehm, P., et al. (2012). &quot;The diversity and evolution of chelicerate hemocyanins.&quot; <u>BMC Evolutionary Biology</u> <b>12</b>: 19.<p>
BACKGROUND: Oxygen transport in the hemolymph of many arthropod species is facilitated by large copper-proteins referred to as hemocyanins. Arthropod hemocyanins are hexamers or oligomers of hexamers, which are characterized by a high O2 transport capacity and a high cooperativity, thereby enhancing O2 supply. Hemocyanin subunit sequences had been available from horseshoe crabs (Xiphosura) and various spiders (Araneae), but not from any other chelicerate taxon. To trace the evolution of hemocyanins and the emergence of the large hemocyanin oligomers, hemocyanin cDNA sequences were obtained from representatives of selected chelicerate classes. RESULTS: Hemocyanin subunits from a sea spider, a scorpion, a whip scorpion and a whip spider were sequenced. Hemocyanin has been lost in Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones, Solifugae and Acari, which may be explained by the evolution of trachea (i.e., taxon Apulmonata). Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was used to reconstruct the evolution of hemocyanin subunits and a relaxed molecular clock approach was applied to date the major events. While the sea spider has a simple hexameric hemocyanin, four distinct subunit types evolved before Xiphosura and Arachnida diverged around 470 Ma ago, suggesting the existence of a 4 x 6mer at that time. Subsequently, independent gene duplication events gave rise to the other distinct subunits in each of the 8 x 6mer hemocyanin of Xiphosura and the 4 x 6mer of Arachnida. The hemocyanin sequences were used to infer the evolutionary history of chelicerates. The phylogenetic trees support a basal position of Pycnogonida, a sister group relationship of Xiphosura and Arachnida, and a sister group relationship of the whip scorpions and the whip spiders. CONCLUSION: Formation of a complex hemocyanin oligomer commenced early in the evolution of euchelicerates. A 4 x 6mer hemocyanin consisting of seven subunit types is conserved in most arachnids since more than 400 Ma, although some entelegyne spiders display selective subunit loss and independent oligomerization. Hemocyanins also turned out to be a good marker to trace chelicerate evolution, which is, however, limited by the loss of hemocyanin in some taxa. The molecular clock calculations were in excellent agreement with the fossil record, also demonstrating the applicability of hemocyanins for such approach.<p>

We have successfully demonstrated a 7.5 ns duration pinhole-apertured backlighter at the Omega laser facility. Pinhole-apertured point-projection backlighting for 8 ns will be useful for imaging evolving features in experiments at the National Ignition Facility. The backlighter consisted of a 20 microm diameter pinhole in a 75 microm thick Ta substrate separated from a Zn emitter (9 keV) by a 400 microm thick high-density carbon piece. The carbon prevented the shock from the laser-driven surface from reaching the substrate before 8 ns and helped minimize x-ray ablation of the pinhole substrate. Grid wires in x-ray framing camera images of a gold grid have a source-limited resolution significantly smaller than the pinhole diameter due to the high aspect ratio of the pinhole, but do not become much smaller at late times.<p>

A single keycap on a standard alphanumeric computer keyboard was instrumented with a piezoelectric load cell and the fingertip motion was recorded with a high-speed video motion analysis system. Contact force histories between the fingertip and the keycap were recorded while four subjects typed a standard text for five minutes. Each keystroke force history is characterized by three distinct phases: (I) keyswitch compression, (II) finger impact and (III) fingertip pulp compression and release. Each keystroke force history contained two relative maxima, one in phase II and one in phase III. The subject mean peak forces ranged from 1.6 to 5.3 N and the subject mean peak fingertip velocities ranged from 0.3 to 0.7 m/s. Motion analyses and force measurements suggest a ballistic model of finger motion during typing.<p>

BACKGROUND: Aberrant brain activation during facial emotion discrimination has been described in chronic schizophrenia, while little is known about early stages of the illness. The aim of the current study was to investigate valence-specific brain activation of emotion discrimination in first-episode schizophrenia. These patients provide the advantage of lacking the effects of long-term medication and chronic illness course and can hence further enhance the understanding of underlying psychopathological mechanisms. METHODS: Using event-related fMRI, we investigated 18 first-episode schizophrenia patients and 18 matched healthy subjects during an explicit emotion discrimination task presenting happy, sad and neutral monochromatic facial expressions. A repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the factors Group (patients, healthy subjects), Gender and Emotion (happy, sad, neutral) was performed on behavioural and functional data. RESULTS: Behavioural performance did not differ between groups. Valence-independent hypoactivations in patients were observed for the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex while hyperactivations emerged in the posterior cingulate and the precuneus. Emotion-specific group differences were revealed in inferior parietal and orbitofrontal brain areas and the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: First-episode schizophrenia already affects areas involved in processing of both, emotions and primary facial information. Our study underlines the role of dysfunctional neural networks as the basis of disturbed social interactions in early schizophrenia.<p>

Embryogenesis is an important stage of marine invertebrates with bi-phasic life cycles, as it conditions their larval and adult life. Throughout embryogenesis, phospholipids (PL) play a key role as an energy source, as well as constituents of biological membranes. However, the dynamics of PL during embryogenesis in marine invertebrates is still poorly studied. The present work used a lipidomic approach to determine how polar lipid profiles shift during embryogenesis in two sympatric estuarine crabs, Carcinus maenas and Necora puber. The combination of thin layer chromatography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry allowed us to achieve an unprecedented resolution on PL classes and molecular species present on newly extruded embryos (stage 1) and those near hatching (stage 3). Embryogenesis proved to be a dynamic process, with four PL classes being recorded in stage 1 embryos (68 molecular species in total) and seven PL classes at stage 3 embryos (98 molecular species in total). The low interspecific difference recorded in the lipidomic profiles of stage 1 embryos appears to indicate the existence of similar maternal investment. The same pattern was recorded for stage 3 embryos revealing a similar catabolism of embryonic resources during incubation for both crab species.<p>

The irrational prescribing of drugs seems to be a general problem in medical practice, occasionally leading to serious consequences. In order to improve the drug prescribing performance of medical students, a compulsory context-learning pharmacotherapy module was implemented in 1998 in the medical curriculum of 2nd-4th-year medical students at theVU University Medical Center (VUmc), Amsterdam, The Netherlands. As part of this program, preclinical medical students are taught how to select, prescribe, and evaluate a drug regimen rationally. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of this preclinical pharmacotherapy program on the quality of rational prescribing during the ensuing clinical clerkship of these students in internal medicine. The results of this study indicate that preclinical context-learning in pharmacotherapy leads to the use of more rational prescribing modalities by medical students during their ensuing clinical clerkship in internal medicine. This effect was obtained not only with respect to the clinical topics in which training had been given as part of the pharmacotherapy curriculum, but also for other disease situations that the students dealt with. This implies that students not only remember the specific information they have learned during the training, but are also able to apply the acquired skills in new situations (transfer effect).<p>

PURPOSE: Core biopsy is considered to be a highly accurate method for gaining preoperative diagnosis of breast cancer. The purpose of this study is to compare the results of core biopsy with those of the surgical excision specimen. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 567 core biopsies with subsequent surgical excision were performed. RESULTS: In 488 patients, invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in the preoperative biopsy and in 486 patients (99.6%) the surgical specimen showed identical results. In 160 of the 502 patients (32%) with invasive breast cancer, DCIS was found in the surgical specimen but was not diagnosed in the biopsy. Estrogen and progesterone receptor demonstrated a high rate of agreement, Her2/neu analysis showed a complete concordance in 54% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Core biopsies allow diagnosis of invasive breast cancer with high accuracy. Levels of agreement have to be improved for the detection of DCIS and Her2/neu status.<p>

Chrysoperla externa (Hagen) is a generalist predator in agroecosystems. We assessed the effect of cypermethrin, endosulfan, methoxyfenozide, and spinosad on immature development time, survivorship, sex ratio, fecundity, and fertility on this organism in laboratory toxicity tests. Effects on second-generation organisms were also studied. Exposures were realized by dipping &lt;/=24-h-old eggs in pesticide solutions at maximum field recommended concentrations (MFRCs) registered in Argentina. Although no significant ovicidal effect was detected with any of the compounds, endosulfan and cypermethrin produced 96 and 100% mortality, respectively, on larvae 48 h after hatching. Spinosad caused significantly higher mortality than controls but this effect was less immediate, lasted longer and was less intense than effects with conventional insecticides. Methoxifenozide did not produce significant mortality in any stages. Spinosad and cypermethrin reduced egg development time, but no similar effects were observed with other insecticides. Methoxyfenozide inhibited the fecundity during the first 24 h; however, fertility was not affected. Spinosad had no effect on fecundity or fertility of the adults. No long-term detrimental effects on the progeny were detected for spinosad and methoxyfenozide. Conventional insecticides (endosulfan and cypermethrin) were more toxic than biorationals ones when applied to eggs of C. externa. The ecotoxicological studies showed the neonate-L(1) larvae as a susceptible developmental stage. These data indicate that the biorational insecticides tested are compatible with conserving C. externa.<p>

BACKGROUND: Research scientists and companies working in the domains of biomedicine and genomics are increasingly faced with the problem of efficiently locating, within the vast body of published scientific findings, the critical pieces of information that are needed to direct current and future research investment. RESULTS: In this report we describe approaches taken within the scope of the second BioCreative competition in order to solve two aspects of this problem: detection of novel protein interactions reported in scientific articles, and detection of the experimental method that was used to confirm the interaction. Our approach to the former problem is based on a high-recall protein annotation step, followed by two strict disambiguation steps. The remaining proteins are then combined according to a number of lexico-syntactic filters, which deliver high-precision results while maintaining reasonable recall. The detection of the experimental methods is tackled by a pattern matching approach, which has delivered the best results in the official BioCreative evaluation. CONCLUSION: Although the results of BioCreative clearly show that no tool is sufficiently reliable for fully automated annotations, a few of the proposed approaches (including our own) already perform at a competitive level. This makes them interesting either as standalone tools for preliminary document inspection, or as modules within an environment aimed at supporting the process of curation of biomedical literature.<p>

BACKGROUND: Basal nitric oxide (NO) activity has a pivotal role in the regulation of glomerular hemodynamics, and in animal experiments, its alteration has been associated with morphological changes characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational-study during a mean follow-up of 2.1 years. SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: 66 hypertensive patients (aged 30 to 80 years) with type 2 diabetes and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 80 mL/min/1.73 m(2) with normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria. PREDICTOR: Mean arterial pressure during follow-up during treatment with telmisartan or ramipril for 9 weeks, followed by treatment according to the discretion of the individual primary care physician. OUTCOMES &amp; MEASUREMENTS: Renal vascular resistance, renal plasma flow, GFR, and change in renal plasma flow in response to infusion of the NO synthase inhibitor N-monomethyl-L-arginine as an indicator of basal NO activity in the renal vasculature. RESULTS: 50 of 66 patients could be reexamined. At follow-up, mean arterial pressure decreased from 106 +/- 9.1 to 100 +/- 11 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001). Body mass index and hemoglobin A(1c) levels were unaltered. Renal vascular resistance decreased (from 128 +/- 44 to 103 +/- 30 mm Hg/mL/min/1.73 m(2); P &lt; 0.001), renal plasma flow increased (from 490 +/- 133 to 589 +/- 154 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P &lt; 0.001), and GFR did not change (113 +/- 22 versus 116 +/- 26 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.4) during follow-up. The decrease in renal plasma flow in response to N-monomethyl-l-arginine infusion was more pronounced at follow-up (-56.7 +/- 39 versus -73.4 +/- 48 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P = 0.02), indicating improved basal NO activity. After adjustment for possible confounders, patients with a marked decrease in mean arterial pressure showed more improved basal NO activity during follow-up than those with a less pronounced decrease in mean arterial pressure (P = 0.04). LIMITATIONS: Patients were treated according to the discretion of the individual primary care physician. CONCLUSIONS: During follow-up, renal vascular resistance, renal plasma flow, and renal endothelial function (indicated by basal NO activity) improved. Better blood pressure control was associated with improved endothelial function of the renal vasculature, thereby potentially mediating the changes in renal hemodynamics.<p>

PAK I is a member of the PAK (p21-activated protein kinase) family and is activated by Cdc42 (Jakobi, R., Chen, C.-J., Tuazon, P. T., and Traugh, J. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 6206-6211). To examine the effects of PAK I on cleavage arrest, subfemtomole amounts of endogenously active (58 kDa) and inactive (60 kDa) PAK I and a tryptic peptide (37 kDa) containing the active catalytic domain were injected into one blastomere of 2-cell frog embryos. Active PAK I resulted in cleavage arrest in the injected blastomere at mitotic metaphase, whereas the uninjected blastomere progressed through mid- to late cleavage. Injection of other protein kinases at similar concentrations had no effect on cleavage. Endogenous PAK I was highly active in frog oocytes, and antibody to PAK I reacted specifically with protein of 58-60 kDa. PAK I protein was decreased at 60 min post-fertilization, with little or no PAK I protein or activity detectable at 80 min post-fertilization or in 2-cell embryos. At the 4-cell stage PAK I protein increased, but the protein kinase was present primarily as an inactive form. Rac2 and Cdc42, but not Rac 1, were identified in oocytes and throughout early embryo development. Thus, PAK I appears to be a potent cytostatic protein kinase involved in maintaining cells in a non-dividing state. PAK I activity is high in oocytes and appears to be regulated by degradation/synthesis and through autophosphorylation via binding of Cdc42. PAK I may act through regulation of the stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and/or by direct regulation of multiple metabolic pathways.<p>

We studied the amino acid and lipid dynamics during embryogenesis of Homarus gammarus. Major essential amino acids (EAA) in the last stage of embryonic development were arginine, lysine and leucine; major nonessential amino acids (NEAA) were glutamic acid, aspartic acid, valine and glycine. The highest percent of utilization occurred in respect to EAA (27.8%), mainly due to a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) of methionine (38.3%) and threonine (36.0%). NEAA also decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05, 11.4%), namely serine (38.1%), tyrosine (26.4%) and glutamic acid (25.7%). In contrast, the free amino acid content increased significantly (p&lt;0.05) during embryonic development, especially the free nonessential amino acids (FNEAA). In the last stage, the most abundant FNEAA were glycine, proline, alanine and taurine, and the major free essential amino acids (FEAA) were arginine, lysine and leucine. Lipid content decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05) during embryonic development. A substantial decrease in all neutral lipid classes was observed (&gt;80% of utilization). Major fatty acids were 16:0, 18:0, 18:1n-9, 18:2n-6, 18:3n-3, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3. Unsaturated (UFA) and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were used up at similar rates (76.5% and 76.3%, respectively). Within UFA, monounsaturates (MUFA) were consumed more than polyunsaturates (PUFA) (82.9% and 67.5%, respectively).<p>

Polyclonal antibodies directed against D. variabilis vitellin were utilized for immunocytochemistry at the ultrastructural level. We localized vitellogenin (Vg) in rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae, secretory granules and secreted products of fat body trophocytes and midgut vitellogenic cells from feeding and ovipositing females. Vg was localized in the oocyte Golgi bodies and in the yolk bodies of both feeding and ovipositing females. Uptake of exogenous Vg was indicated by the presence of immunospecific gold probe in coated pits and coated vesicles at the apical plasma membrane of oocytes from females in rapid engorgement and oviposition. In unmated females little detectable evidence of Vg uptake by developing oocytes suggests that mating and host detachment signal the beginning of vitellogenesis. We conclude that fat body trophocytes, midgut vitellogenic cells and oocytes are involved in the synthesis and/or processing of Vg and that feeding is the signal associated with the initiation of Vg synthesis and/or processing.<p>

BACKGROUND: The prevalence of childhood obesity is rapidly increasing, and many obese children suffer from emotional and behavior problems and mental disorders. Associations with social stigmatization of obesity, maternal psychopathology, socioeconomic status (SES) and resilience factors are discussed. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize maternal psychopathology to have an impact on the psychological well-being of an obese child. We further hypothesize that competence factors within the child are important key factors that influence the way a child deals with the psychological burden of obesity. METHOD: A referred clinical sample of 59 obese children with their mothers was assessed using a structured clinical interview for DSM-IV diagnosis and questionnaires for child and maternal psychopathology, SES, body mass index (BMI), and percent overweight. Correlations, hierarchical linear and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between mothers and child and the impact of potential predictors. RESULTS: Mental disorders were found in 37.3% of the obese children in our sample. Maternal anxiety predicted the mother reported child's internalizing problems as well as the child's depression and anxiety self report scores. The mental disorder status of the mother predicted the child's internalizing problems, and maternal binge eating disorder (BED) had an impact on the mental disorder of the child. If the child's total competences were included in the hierarchical regression model they predicted the child's outcome in all three subscales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), thereby reducing the effect of maternal anxiety to influencing the child's depression score only. Neither SES nor the child's percent overweight accounted for the child's wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: Although maternal psychopathology and diagnosis of mental disorder had some impact on the psychological well-being of the child, the child's competences showed a significant negative association with the problem scales. More research on parental and children's skills and competences will highlight the complex interaction of childhood obesity, comorbidity of mental disorders, and resilience factors and will lead to additional approaches for intervention.<p>

Prostaglandins (PG) are oxygenated derivatives of C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids. In mammals, these compounds have been shown to play key roles in haemostasis, sleep-wake regulation, smooth muscle tone, and vaso-, temperature and immune regulation. In invertebrates, PGs have been reported to perform similar roles and are involved in the control of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, ion transport and defence. Although there is often a detailed understanding of the actions of these compounds in invertebrates such as insects, knowledge of their mechanism of biosynthesis is often lacking. This account provides a critical review of our current knowledge on the structure and modes of biosynthesis of PGs in invertebrates, with particular reference to aquatic invertebrates. It emphasises some of the most recent findings, which suggest that some PGs have been misidentified. Prostaglandins in invertebrates can be categorised into two main types; the classical forms, such as PGE2 and PGD2 that are found in mammals, and novel forms including clavulones, bromo- and iodo-vulones and various PGA2 and PGE2 esters. A significant number of reports of PG identification in invertebrates have relied upon methods such as enzyme immunoassay that do not have the necessary specificity to ensure the validity of the identification. For example, in the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, although there are PG-like compounds that bind to antibodies raised against PGE2, mass spectrometric analysis failed to confirm the presence of this and other classical PGs. Therefore, care should be taken in drawing conclusions about what PGs are formed in invertebrates without employing appropriate analytical methods. Finally, the recent publication of the Ciona genome should facilitate studies on the nature and mode of biosynthesis of PGs in this advanced deuterostomate invertebrate.<p>

We studied the applicability of interleukin-6 Pseudomonas exotoxin fusion protein (IL-6PE4E) for treatment of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). Leukemic cells from five out of 10 AML patients studied expressed IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and proliferation in vitro was inhibited in four of these cases. The potential of this approach in vivo was tested in a pre-clinical model for AML; the Brown Norway acute myelocytic leukemia (BNML). To obtain IL-6R expression levels on BNML cells comparable to the numbers expressed on human AML, human IL-6R gene transfectants of the BNML sub-line LT12 (LT12/IL-6R) were generated. IL-6PE4E is cytotoxic in vitro to LT12/IL-6R expressing 1400 high affinity IL-6R per cell with 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis at 1 ng/ml. In vivo treatment of leukemic rats carrying LT12/IL-6R leukemia indicated that the maximal tolerated dose of IL-6PE4E was 275 +/- 25 microg/kg/day, when continuously administered for 7 days and resulted in a 90% reduction in leukemic cell load. At this dose level of IL-6PE4E no reduction of normal hemopoietic progenitors was seen in non-leukemic rats. At higher dose levels (350-1050 microg/kg/day) severe systemic toxicity was encountered. On the basis of these pre-clinical studies the feasibility of growth factor-toxins for selective in vivo targeting to AML cells is evaluated.<p>

Rozen, D. E., et al. (2009). &quot;Death and cannibalism in a seasonal environment facilitate bacterial coexistence.&quot; <u>Ecology Letters</u> <b>12</b>(1): 34-44.<p>
Bacterial populations can evolve and adapt to become diverse niche specialists, even in seemingly homogeneous environments. One source of this diversity arises from newly 'constructed' niches that result from the activities of the bacteria themselves. Ecotypes specialized to exploit these distinct niches can subsequently coexist via frequency-dependent interactions. Here, we describe a novel form of niche construction that is based upon differential death and cannibalism, and which evolved during 20 000 generations of experimental evolution in Escherichia coli in a seasonal environment with alternating growth and starvation. In one of 12 populations, two monophyletic ecotypes, S and L, evolved that stably coexist with one another. When grown and then starved in monoculture, the death rate of S exceeds that of L, whereas the reverse is observed in mixed cultures. As shown by experiments and numerical simulations, the competitive advantage of S cells is increased by extending the period of starvation, and this advantage results from their cannibalization of the debris of lysed L cells, which allows the S cells to increase both their growth rate and total cell density. At the molecular level, the polymorphism is associated with divergence in the activity of the alternative sigma factor RpoS, with S cells displaying no detectable activity, while L cells show increased activity relative to the ancestral genotype. Our results extend the repertoire of known cross-feeding mechanisms in microbes to include cannibalism during starvation, and confirm the central roles for niche construction and seasonality in the maintenance of microbial polymorphisms.<p>

The codling moth (Cydia pomonella) is a major insect pest of apples worldwide. It overwinters as a diapausing fifth instar larva. The overwintering is often a critical part of the insect life-cycle in temperate zone. This study brings detailed analysis of seasonal changes in lipid composition and fluidity in overwintering larvae sampled in the field. Fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol (TG) depots in the fat body and relative proportions of phospholipid (PL) molecular species in biological membranes were analyzed. In addition, temperature of melting (Tm) in TG depots was assessed by using differential scanning calorimetry and the conformational order (fluidity) of PL membranes was analyzed by measuring the anisotropy of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene probe in membrane vesicles. We observed a significant increase of relative proportion of linoleic acid (C18:2n6) at the expense of palmitic acid (C16:0) in TG depots during the larval transition to diapause accompanied with decreasing melting temperature of total lipids, which might increase the accessibility of depot fats for enzymatic breakdown during overwintering. The fluidity of membranes was maintained very high irrespective of developmental mode or seasonally changing acclimation status of larvae. The seasonal changes in PL composition were relatively small. We discuss these results in light of alternative survival strategies of codling moth larvae (supercooling vs. freezing), variability and low predictability of environmental conditions, and other cold tolerance mechanisms such as extending the supercooling capacity and massive accumulation of cryoprotective metabolites.<p>

BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive marker of the acute-phase response, has been associated with future cardiovascular endpoints independently of other risk factors. A joint analysis of the role of risk factors in predicting mean concentrations and variation of high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) in serum has not been carried out previously. METHODS: We used data from 1003 myocardial infarction (MI) survivors who had hsCRP measured monthly up to 8 times and multivariate mixed effects statistical models to study the role of time-variant and -invariant factors on the geometric mean of and the intraindividual variation in hsCRP concentrations. RESULTS: Patients with &gt; or =6.5% glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) had 26.2% higher hsCRP concentrations (95% CI, 7.2%-48.6%) and 20.7% greater variation in hsCRP values (P = 0.0034) than patients with lower baseline Hb A(1c) values (&lt;6.5%). Similar but less pronounced differences were seen in patients with a self-reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. hsCRP concentrations showed less variation in patients who reported angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, or emphysema (-11.0%, -24.9%, and -41.6%, respectively, vs patients without these conditions) but greater variation in males and smokers (+24.8% and +27.3%, respectively, vs females and nonsmokers). Exposures in the 24 h before blood sampling, including exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption, and extreme stress, did not have a major impact. CONCLUSIONS: One or 2 hsCRP measurements may not be sufficient to adequately characterize different patient groups after MI with similar precisions. We found hsCRP concentrations to be especially variable in males, smokers, and patients with increased Hb A(1c) values.<p>

Wolf spiders' (Lycosidae) maternal behaviour includes a specific phase called &quot;egg brooding&quot; which consists of guarding and carrying an egg-sac throughout the incubation period. The transport of an egg-sac can restrict mothers' exploratory and locomotor activity, in particular when foraging. The present study details the ontogeny of maternal behaviour and assesses the influence of age of egg-sac (or embryos' developmental stage) on vagrant wolf spider Pardosa saltans females' exploration and locomotion. We observed these spiders' maternal behaviour in the laboratory and evaluated their locomotor activity using a digital activity recording device. Our subjects were virgin females (without egg-sac) and first time mothers (with her egg-sac) who were divided into three groups. The first group of mothers were tested on the day the egg-sac was built (day 0), and the females of the other two groups were tested 10 or 15days after they had built their egg-sac. We evaluated the effects of the presence and the loss of egg-sac on mothers' activity. Pardosa saltans females' behaviour depended on mothers' physiological state and/or age of egg-sac (developmental stage of embryos). Virgin females' behaviour was not modified by the presence of an egg-sac in their environment. Mothers' reactions to the presence, the loss and the recovery of their egg-sac varied during the maternal cycle. Maternal behaviour changed with age of egg-sac, but the levels of locomotor activity of mothers with egg-sacs was similar to those of virgin females. Loss of egg-sac modified the maternal behaviour and locomotor activity of all mothers; these modifications were greater on &quot;day 15&quot; when embryos had emerged from eggs. All mothers were able to retrieve their egg-sacs and to re-attach them to their spinnerets.<p>

Many arachnids like other terrestrial arthropods, provide extensive maternal care. Few studies have quantified the underlying physiological costs of maternal care. We investigated how maternal care affects the free-moving wolf spider's (Pardosa saltans) energy requirements. We described in detail their basic reproduction biology (i.e. carrying cocoon and young) and we evaluated the variation in the females' energy reserves during maternal care. Our results show that mothers guard eggs until hatching and then guard their spiderlings for 27-30 more days. Laboratory observations indicated that spiderlings start leaving the maternal abdomen gradually 5-7days after hatching. Females carry an egg sac (cocoon) that can weigh up to 77% of their post-reproduction weight and carry young that weigh 87-100% of their body mass. Females lost weight over time despite regular food intake, while carrying cocoon and young; but their weights increased gradually during the dispersal of young. The contributions of proteins, glucose and triglycerides to maintain females' energy were calculated. Their energetic state varied during maternal care, in particular lipid levels declined, during the care of spiderlings when the females' predatory behaviour was inhibited. Our results show that the maternal care provided by P. saltans females is particularly costly physiologically, during the 30days following egg sac formation and development of spiderlings, even when food is available.<p>

This study presents the first characterisation of the silk lipids of the cocoons of a wolf spider (Pardosa saltans). Wolf spiders' maternal behaviour is complex and involves guarding a cocoon for several weeks, and so cocoons must emit cues to ensure their care and the development of juveniles. We investigated cues associated with the cocoon silk. We assessed qualitative changes of the lipid contents and the composition of cocoon silk in relation to the development of P. saltans wolf spider juveniles. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of P. saltans' cocoon silk revealed 62 different lipid compounds. The compounds were aliphatic alcohols, glycerides, fatty acids and their methylesters containing 13-29 carbon atoms. We reveal for the first time the presence of ethanolamides and phytosterol on cocoon silk. Qualitative and quantitative changes occur during the embryonic period, as some polar compounds, such as diglycerides and ethanolamides, disappeared while hydrocarbons emerge, and fatty acids disappeared later during the post-embryonic period. Qualitative and/or quantitative changes could play a role in tactochemical communication between mothers and their cocoon. However, mothers do not modify their behaviour in relation to the developmental stage of their cocoon. Mothers' behaviour appears to be linked to both internal (physiological state) and external mechanisms (signals from the cocoon).<p>

Development and validation of crash test dummies and computational models that are capable of predicting the risk of injury to all parts of the knee-thigh-hip (KTH) complex in frontal impact requires knowledge of the force transmitted from the knee to the hip under knee impact loading. To provide this information, the knee impact responses of whole and segmented cadavers were measured over a wide range of knee loading conditions. These data were used to develop and help validate a computational model, which was used to estimate force transmitted to the cadaver hip. Approximately 250 tests were conducted using five unembalmed midsize male cadavers. In these tests, the knees were symmetrically impacted with a 255-kg padded impactor using three combinations of knee-impactor padding and velocity that spanned the range of knee loading conditions produced in FMVSS 208 and NCAP tests. Each subject was tested in four conditions. Following test of whole seated cadavers, the subjects were impacted after the connection between the thigh flesh and pelvis was cut, after the thigh flesh was removed, and after the torso was removed. Applied force and femur and pelvis acceleration data from these tests and results of other studies were used with data on static body segment masses to develop and validate a one-dimensional lumped-parameter model of the body. Simulation of the whole body cadaver tests performed with this model predict that approximately 54% of the peak force applied to the knee was transmitted to the hip for all three impact velocities. Additional simulations with the model in which knee impact conditions were varied over a wider range of loading conditions indicate that the percentage drop in force between the knee and the hip is relatively constant over the range of knee impact conditions that are of interest for injury assessment. Simulation results also indicate that high-rate, short-duration knee loading by a rigid surface is more likely to produce knee/distal femur fractures and less likely to produce hip fractures due to laxity in the hip that delays recruitment of pelvis mass and the development of fracture-level forces at the hip until after the fracture tolerance of the knee/femur has been exceeded.<p>

46 patients underwent mitral valve repair at the Regional Hospital in Trondheim/St. Elisabeth Heart Clinic, during the period 1983-95. There were 20 female patients. The valve pathology was ischemic in 40%, rheumatic in 10% and other or unknown in 50%. The surgical technique included commissurotomy (n = 9), ring annuloplasty (n = 18), resection of posterior leaflet (n = 12), Kay annuloplasty (n = 10), shortening of chordae (n = 3) and other techniques (n = 2). Postoperative complications included wound infection (n = 1), pneumonia (n = 1), mediastinitis (n = 1), pleural effusion (n = 5), renal failure (n = 1) and multi-organ failure (n = 1). One patient required re-exploration for postoperative bleeding. Three (6.5%) patients died within 30 days of surgery due to low cardiac output (n = 2) and multi-organ failure (n = 1). Nine patients (21%) died later. At follow up, within one year of surgery, marked functional improvement was registered, with only one patient in NYHA class III and none in class IV.<p>

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are a family of detoxifying enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione (GSH) to electrophiles, thereby increasing the solubility of xenobiotics and aiding its excretion from the cell. The present work presents the inhibition of a mu-class GST of the marine shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei by copper (Cu2+) and cadmium (Cd2+). The protein was overexpressed in bacteria and its enzymatic activity measured using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The mean inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) for shrimp GST against Cu2+) was 4.77 microM and for Cd2+ was 0.39 microM. A molecular model of the protein based on the crystal structure of a maize GST bound to cadmium showed that the metal binds in the GSH-binding site by coordination with Asp and Gln residues. These results are consistent with the experimental data and suggest that sublethal concentration of metals may affect the capacity of the organism to detoxify pesticides or xenobiotics.<p>

TNFRSF13B encodes transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), a B cell- specific tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member. Both biallelic and monoallelic TNFRSF13B mutations were identified in patients with common variable immunodeficiency disorders. The genetic complexity and variable clinical presentation of TACI deficiency prompted us to evaluate the genetic, immunologic, and clinical condition in 50 individuals with TNFRSF13B alterations, following screening of 564 unrelated patients with hypogammaglobulinemia. We identified 13 new sequence variants. The most frequent TNFRSF13B variants (C104R and A181E; n=39; 6.9%) were also present in a heterozygous state in 2% of 675 controls. All patients with biallelic mutations had hypogammaglobulinemia and nearly all showed impaired binding to a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL). However, the majority (n=41; 82%) of the pa-tients carried monoallelic changes in TNFRSF13B. Presence of a heterozygous mutation was associated with antibody deficiency (P&lt; .001, relative risk 3.6). Heterozygosity for the most common mutation, C104R, was associated with disease (P&lt; .001, relative risk 4.2). Furthermore, heterozygosity for C104R was associated with low numbers of IgD(-)CD27(+) B cells (P= .019), benign lymphoproliferation (P&lt; .001), and autoimmune complications (P= .001). These associations indicate that C104R heterozygosity increases the risk for common variable immunodeficiency disorders and influences clinical presentation.<p>

OBJECTIVE: This study compares the effect of topical versus intravenous (IV) administration of synthetic WIN 55-212-2 (WIN) or timolol on intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS: WIN or timolol were administered either topically or by IV in normotensive New Zealand white rabbits. IOP was measured at baseline and 30, 60, and 120 min after administration (n = 4 per group). Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were measured concomitantly with IOP. RESULTS: IV administration of 0.1 mg/kg WIN reduced IOP by 30% after 30 min, which continued to decline for up to 120 min. Timolol injection (25 mu g/kg) also reduced IOP by 25% after 30 min but was not sustained. In comparison, both topical WIN (1.0%) and timolol (0.5%) reduced IOP by 20% from baseline after 30 min. IV injection of either WIN or timolol significantly reduced HR to 155.4 +/- 11.4 bpm and 165.9 +/- 11.1 bpm, respectively, from a baseline of 256.3 +/- 9.9 bpm. Topical administration was well tolerated and did not affect behavior, BP, or HR. CONCLUSION: Topical administration of either WIN or timolol did not decrease IOP as much as IV administration, but the lack of systemic or local toxicity could make it the safer alternative.<p>

We report the results of an inter-laboratory exercise on typing of autosomal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for forensic genetic investigations in crime cases. The European DNA Profiling Group (EDNAP), a working group under the International Society for Forensic Genetics (ISFG), organised the exercise. A total of 11 European and one US forensic genetic laboratories tested a subset of a 52 SNP-multiplex PCR kit developed by the SNPforID consortium. The 52 SNP-multiplex kit amplifies 52 DNA fragments with 52 autosomal SNP loci in one multiplex PCR. The 52 SNPs are detected in two separate single base extension (SBE) multiplex reactions with 29 and 23 SNPs, respectively, using SNaPshot kit, capillary electrophoresis and multicolour fluorescence detection. For practical reasons, only the 29 SBE multiplex reaction was carried out by the participating laboratories. A total of 11 bloodstains on FTA cards including a sample of poor quality and a negative control were sent to the laboratories together with the essential reagents for the initial multiplex PCR and the multiplex SBE reaction. The total SNP locus dropout rate was 2.8% and more than 50% of the dropouts were observed with the poor quality sample. The overall rate of discrepant SNP allele assignments was 2.0%. Two laboratories reported 60% of all the discrepancies. Two laboratories reported all 29 SNP alleles in all 10 positive samples correctly. The results of the collaborative exercise were surprisingly good and demonstrate that SNP typing with SBE, capillary electrophoresis and multicolour detection methods can be developed for forensic genetics.<p>

In this paper, we review the current knowledge about the usage of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins as energy source by marine crustaceans during starvation. Crustaceans are a large and diverse group including some economically important species. The efforts to culture them for human consumption has prompted the interest to understand the preferences of energy sources to be applied for feed formulation and cost reduction. Important differences have been found among species and appear to be related not only to the biochemistry and physiology of nutrition, but also to the living environment of the crustaceans. Furthermore, crustaceans undergo morphological, physiological and behavioral changes due to their natural growing process that affect their feeding habits, an aspect that should be carefully considered. We discuss the current information on marine crustaceans about energy usage and describe areas of future research, where starvation studies render important insights.<p>

Arthropods include chelicerates, crustaceans, and insects that all have open circulation systems and thus require different properties of their coagulation system than vertebrates. Although the clotting reaction in the chelicerate horseshoe crab (Family: Limulidae) has been described in details, the overall protein composition of the resulting clot has not been analyzed for any of the chelicerates. The largest class among the chelicerates is the arachnids, which includes spiders, ticks, mites, and scorpions. Here, we use a mass spectrometry-based approach to characterize the spider hemolymph clot proteome from the Brazilian whiteknee tarantula, Acanthoscurria geniculata. We focused on the insoluble part of the clot and demonstrated high concentrations of proteins homologous to the hemostasis-related and multimerization-prone von Willebrand factor. These proteins, which include hemolectins and vitellogenin homologous, were previously identified as essential components of the hemolymph clot in crustaceans and insects. Their presence in the spider hemolymph clot suggests that the origin of these proteins' function in coagulation predates the split between chelicerates and mandibulata. The clot proteome reveals that the major proteinaceous component is the oxygen-transporting and phenoloxidase-displaying abundant hemolymph protein hemocyanin, suggesting that this protein also plays a role in clot biology. Furthermore, quantification of the peptidome after coagulation revealed the simultaneous activation of both the innate immune system and the coagulation system. In general, many of the identified clot-proteins are related to the innate immune system, and our results support the previously suggested crosstalk between immunity and coagulation in arthropods.<p>

Energy homeostasis is an essential process during oogenesis, nutrients are required for suitable embryonic development, and recently, studies have investigated metabolic activity during this process. This work aims the investigation of dynamics of energy source utilization of Rhynchophorus palmarum during embryogenesis. For this, we first evaluated the mobilization kinetics of the lipids and glycogen. Thereafter, the synthesis of RNA, protein, and the involvement of enzyme of the glycolytic and pentose-phosphate pathways. Results showed that lipid content decreased in contrast with the lipase activity. The total glycogen amounts it was partly consumed and the glucose content increased, but then values remained stable until hatching. Total RNA content increased, and no significant changes in total protein content were observed. A study of the glycolytic pathway data showed activity of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase at the beginning of embryogenesis. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate formed is driven into the pentose-phosphate pathway viewed the high activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Finally, these results showed that mobilization of different energy sources together with different enzymatic activities has an important role in embryonic development of R. palmarum.<p>

The processes of accumulation and mobilization of carbohydrate stores in eggs of Rhodnius prolixus were analyzed. During oogenesis, the total amounts of glycogen, glucose, and trehalose increased with an accumulation of proteins, especially when oocytes grew from 1.0 to 1.5 mm in length. At 2.0 mm length, when oocytes were ready for oviposition, nutrient reserves did not increase appreciably and trehalose content decreased. Mating did not affect the final content of carbohydrates or proteins in oocytes of mated and virgin females. A trehalase activity was detected in follicles containing vitellogenic oocytes, 1.0 and 1.5 mm length, in both mated and virgin females. This activity was extremely low in chorionated, 2.0-mm oocytes. After oviposition, glycogen content decreased in fertilized eggs, but not in unfertilized ones, and some was present in newly hatched nymphs. Glucose content remained constant in unfertilized eggs, but increased in fertilized ones, while total protein amount was constant in both groups after egg laying.<p>

Scales of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 were correlated to identify which measures predicted depression among 219 women and 115 men. Despite prevalence data indicating that dysphoria is more common among females than males, sex did not predict MMPI-2 Depression scores in this sample. Masculine Gender Role was negatively predictive of depression for both sexes. High scores on Feminine Gender Role were slightly predictive of depression among men but not among women. An effective strategy for coping with depression involves managing stress causing circumstances as opposed to managing the feelings that result from stress. Persons of either sex who score high on Masculine Gender Role endorse traits that are compatible with the better strategy.<p>

Insect vitellogenin and yolk protein receptors (VgR/YPR) are newly discovered members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family, which is characterized by a highly conserved arrangement of repetitive modular elements homologous to functionally unrelated proteins. The insect VgR/YPRs are unique in having two clusters of complement-type cysteine-rich (class A) repeats or modules, with five modules in the first cluster and seven in the second cluster, unlike classical LDLRs which have a single seven-module cluster, vertebrate VgRs and very low density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLR) which have a single eight-module cluster, and LDLR-related proteins (LRPs) and megalins which have four clusters of 2-7, 8, 10, and 11 modules. Alignment of clusters across subfamilies by conventional alignment programs is problematic because of the repetitive nature of the component modules which may have undergone rearrangements, duplications, and deletions during evolution. To circumvent this problem, we &quot;fingerprinted&quot; each class A module in the different clusters by identifying those amino acids that are both relatively conserved and relatively unique within the cluster. Intercluster reciprocal comparisons of fingerprints and aligned sequences allowed us to distinguish four cohorts of modules reflecting shared recent ancestry. All but two of the 57 modules examined could be assigned to one of these four cohorts designated A, B, C, and D. Alignment of clusters based on modular cohorts revealed that all clusters are derived from a single primordial cluster of at least seven modules with a consensus arrangement of CDCADBC. All extant clusters examined are consistent with this consensus, though none matches it perfectly. This analysis also revealed that the eight-module clusters in vertebrate VgRs, insect VgR/YPRs, and LRP/megalins are not directly homologous with one another. Assignment of modules to cohorts permitted us to properly align 32 class A clusters from all four LDLR subfamilies for phylogenetic analysis. The results revealed that smaller one-cluster and two-cluster members of the family did not originate from the breakup of a large two-cluster or four-cluster receptor. Similarly, the LRP/megalins did not arise from the duplication of a two-cluster insect VgR/YPR-like progenitor. Rather, it appears that the multicluster receptors were independently constructed from the same single-cluster ancestor.<p>

The recent cloning and sequencing of several insect vitellogenins (Vg), the major yolk protein precursor of most oviparous animals, and the mosquito Vg receptor (VgR) has brought the study of insect vitellogenesis to a new plane. Insect Vgs are homologous to nematode and vertebrate Vgs. All but one of the insect Vgs for which we know the primary structure are cleaved into two subunits at a site [(R/K)X(R/K)R or RXXR with an adjacent beta-turn] recognized by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases. In four of the Vgs, the cleavage site is near the N-terminus, but in one insect species, it is near the C-terminus of the Vg precursor. Multiple alignments of these Vg sequences indicate that the variation in cleavage location has not arisen through exon shuffling, but through local modifications of the amino acid sequences. A wasp Vg precursor is not cleaved, apparently because the sequence at the presumed ancestral cleavage site has been mutated from RXRR to LYRR and is no longer recognized by convertases. Some insect Vgs contain polyserine domains which are reminiscent of, but not homologous to, the phosvitin domain in vertebrate Vgs. The sequence of the mosquito VgR revealed that it is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family. Though resembling chicken and frog VgRs, which are also members of the LDLR family, it is twice as big, carrying two clusters of cysteine-rich complement-type (Class A) repeats (implicated in ligand-binding) instead of one like vertebrate VgRs and LDLRs. It is very similar in sequence and domain arrangement to the Drosophila yolk protein receptor (YPR), despite a non-vitellogenin ligand for the latter. Though vertebrate VgRs, insect VgR/YPRs, and LDLR-related proteins/megalins all accommodate one cluster of eight Class A repeats, fingerprint analysis of the repeats in these clusters indicate they are not directly homologous with one another, but have undergone differing histories of duplications, deletions, and exon shuffling so that their apparent similarity is superficial. The so-called epidermal growth factor precursor region contains two types of motifs (cysteine-rich Class B repeats and YWXD repeats) which occur independently of one another in diverse proteins, and are often involved in protein-protein interactions, suggesting that they potentially are involved in dimerization of VgRs and other LDLR-family proteins. Like the LDLR, but unlike vertebrate VgRs and the Drosophila YPR, the mosquito VgR contains a putative O-linked sugar region on the extra-cellular side of the transmembrane domain. Its function is unclear, but may protect the receptor from membrane-bound proteases. The cytoplasmic tail of insect VgR/YPRs contains a di-leucine (or leucine-isoleucine) internalization signal, unlike the tight-turn tyrosine motif of other LDLR-family proteins. The importance of understanding the details of yolk protein uptake by oocytes lies in its potential for exploitation in novel insect control strategies, and the molecular characterization of the proteins involved has made the development of such strategies a realistic possibility.<p>

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have the potential to be used for tissue engineering. Nevertheless, they exhibit a low growth rate that limits their availability. In this work we use an alternative model of MSCs from the outer ear (ear mesenchymal stem cells, E-MSCs). These cells bear the characteristics of progenitor cells because of their ability to be differentiated into the three lineages of chondrocytes, osteocytes and adipocytes. This model cell population had a threefold higher cell growth rate compared to BM-MSCs. This allowed rapid testing of the scalability in microcarrier culture using bead-to-bead transfer and also enabled their expansion in a 1-l bioreactor. The cells were able to maintain their potential for differentiation into the above three lineages. Therefore, E-MSCs appear to be an attractive model for assessing a number of bioengineering parameters that may affect the behavior of adult stem cells in culture.<p>

Laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) is a valuable adjunct in clinical management of patients with voice disorders. LEMG is valuable in differentiating vocal fold paresis/paralysis from cricoarytenoid joint fixation. Our data indicate that visual assessment alone is inadequate to diagnose neuromuscular dysfunction in the larynx and that diagnoses based on vocal dynamics assessment and strobovideolaryngoscopy are wrong in nearly one-third of cases, based on LEMG results. LEMG has also proven valuable in diagnosing neuromuscular dysfunction in some dysphonic patients with no obvious vocal fold movement abnormalities observed during strobovideolaryngoscopy. Review of 751 patients suggests that there is a correlation between the severity of paresis and treatment required to achieve satisfactory outcomes; that is, LEMG allows us to predict whether patients will probably require therapy alone or therapy combined with surgery. Additional evidence-based research should be encouraged to evaluate efficacy further.<p>

The range of allosteric interaction in the 24-meric hemocyanin from the tarantula Eurypelma californicum was studied by measuring the oxygen-binding properties of defined oligomeric fragments. Dissociation intermediates comprising 19, 12, 7 or 6 subunits were obtained by incubation of native hemocyanin with 10 mM-cysteine at pH 4.4, with 40 mM-dithiothreitol at pH 7 or 8, by short-term alkaline (pH 9.6) treatment or by treatment with 4 M-urea. These could be stabilized by returning to neutral buffer conditions and, in the case of the dodecamer, by carboxymethylation. Conditions were chosen so that part of the starting material remained intact to serve as control in the oxygen-binding measurements. Oxygen equilibrium curves were obtained by a very sensitive fluorimetric/polarographic method. Oxygen affinity and the magnitude of the Bohr effect remain constant from the hexamer up to the control four-hexamer. Co-operativity, in contrast, increases with aggregate size in two steps: n (hexamer) = n (heptamer) less than n (dodecamer) = n (19-mer) less than n (4-hexamer). The characteristic pH-dependence of nH is absent in the hexa- and heptamer but is weakly indicated in the dodecamer, and fully established in the four-hexamer. Results from different preparations are highly consistent, if nH is expressed as a percentage of the control values. Full co-operativity is reached only in the four-hexamer, disproving the dodecameric half-molecule (the smallest repeating unit) as the allosteric unit. The stepwise increase in co-operativity appears to be correlated with higher levels of symmetry in the hierarchy of quaternary structure.<p>

Floronia bucculenta hibernates in the egg stage; the egg sacs are deposited on the leaves of grass tussocks without any shelter. The morphogenesis of the eggs was divided into 10 arbitrarily chosen stages, in order to test the dependence of embryonic development on temperature in the laboratory. The eggs developed slowly at 23 degrees C, 16 degrees , 12.5 degrees ; embryogenesis stopped after 70-45 days, when prosomal appendage rudiments began to form. At 10 degrees , 7.5 degrees , 5 degrees , 0 degrees complete embryogenesis was possible until the emergence of the first complete stage. The eggs developed most rapidly at 5 degrees (mean developmental time 203 days). The egg development was &quot;normal&quot; at 5 degrees and 0 degrees , when compared with the timetable of the embryogenesis of the linyphiid Bathyphantes gracilis, a species which has no egg diapause. At 7.5 degrees and 10 degrees the embryogenesis was strongly delayed during the median phases of development (elongation of the germ band, formation of prosomal appendages); after reversion the development was accelerated (postdiapause phase). After long exposure to low temperatures (-10 degrees to +10 degrees ) the diapause was terminated. A temperature of 0 degrees was optimal (minimal time of exposure 8-9 weeks). The time required for embryonic development of postdiapause eggs decreased hyperbolically with increasing temperature. In the field the median phases of embryogenesis were retarded by low ambient temperatures; diapause was terminated from late December to mid-January. The spread of hatching in spring was 7-15 days.During the diapause phase the O2-consumption of the eggs at 25 degrees was depressed. It rose from 1.55 (in late diapause) to 4.21 ml/100 eggs.h at the onset of postdiapause, whereas O2-utilization did not change significantly at 5 degrees (from 0.54 to 0.61 ml/100 eggs.h just after the termination of diapause).The diapause phase was not characterized by higher resistance to cold, drought, or flooding. As compared with single eggs removed from the cocoon, the silken wall of the intact egg sac did not affect the survival of postdiapause eggs exposed to-15 degrees (LD50=28 days); it raised, however, the survival time of eggs exposed to a R.H. of 32% (at 5 degrees ) or flooding by distilled water (at 5 degrees ): from LD50=37 to 68 days at drought, from LD50=30 to 92 days at flooding.Diapause is important for synchronizing the life-cycle of F. bucculenta with the seasonal fluctuations of environment. The egg stage is highly tolerant to the extreme factors of the winter. Some implications of the relation of the studied spider to its habitat are discussed.<p>

Hemoglobin is the major protein in red blood cells and transports oxygen from the lungs to oxygen-demanding tissues, like the brain. Mechanisms that facilitate the uptake of oxygen in the vertebrate brain are unknown. In invertebrates, neuronal hemoglobin serves as intracellular storage molecule for oxygen. Here, we show by immunohistochemistry that hemoglobin is specifically expressed in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the rodent brain, but not in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The neuronal hemoglobin distribution is distinct from the neuroglobin expression pattern on both cellular and subcellular levels. Probing for low oxygen levels in the tissue, we provide evidence that hemoglobin alpha-positive cells in direct neighborhood with hemoglobin alpha-negative cells display a better oxygenation than their neighbors and can be sharply distinguished from those. Neuronal hemoglobin expression is upregulated by injection or transgenic overexpression of erythropoietin and is accompanied by enhanced brain oxygenation under physiologic and hypoxic conditions. Thus we provide a novel mechanism for the neuroprotective actions of erythropoietin under ischemic-hypoxic conditions. We propose that neuronal hemoglobin expression is connected to facilitated oxygen uptake in neurons, and hemoglobin might serve as oxygen capacitator molecule.<p>

The haemolymph lipoprotein of the scorpion, Pandinus imperator was isolated and characterised. Contrary to the lipoproteins of insects and the discoidal HDL-lipoproteins of a crayfish and polychaete, the Pandinus lipoprotein consists of three instead of two apoproteins (apoPiLp I = 230 kDa, apoPiLp II = 130 kDa and apoPiLp III = 120 kDa). The apolipoproteins are arranged in varying stoichiometries as judged by cross-linking experiments. In lipoprotein samples from individual animals, the two smaller subunits occurred in a 1:1 stoichiometry, while the relative amount of the 230 kDa peptide varied. The lipoprotein is a slightly heart-shaped HDL with a diameter of approximately 15 nm. It is present in two densities of 1100 and 1190 kg/m(3), of which the latter is by far more abundant. The native molecular mass was estimated to be approximately 500 kDa. The lipid content was determined as 33.5% and consists of approximately 70% neutral lipids and approximately 30% phospholipids. Strikingly, 42.5% of the phospholipids is phosphatidylserine while phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine account for 55.1% and approximately 2.3%, respectively. Carbohydrate analysis suggests the presence of only high-mannose-type N-glycans. N-glycan profiling shows glycans corresponding to a size of 8.0-11.5 hexose units.<p>

Phenoloxidases play vital roles in invertebrate innate immune reactions, wound closure and sclerotization processes in arthropods. In chelicerates, where phenoloxidases are lacking, phenoloxidase-activity can be induced in the oxygen carrier hemocyanin in vitro by proteolytic cleavage, incubation with the artificial inducer SDS, or lipids. The role of protein-protein interaction has up to now received little attention. This is remarkable, as lipoproteins - complexes of proteins and lipids - are present at high concentrations in arthropod hemolymph. We characterized the three lipoproteins present in tarantula hemolymph, two high-density lipoproteins and one very high-density lipoprotein, and show that the two high-density lipoproteins have distinct structures: the more abundant high-density lipoprotein is an ellipsoid particle with axes of ~22.5 nm and ~16.8 nm, respectively. The second high-density lipoprotein, present only in trace amount, is a large discoidal lipoprotein with a diameter of ~38.4 nm and an on-edge thickness of ~7.1 nm. We further demonstrate that the interaction between lipoproteins and hemocyanin induces phenoloxidase activity in hemocyanin, and propose that this activation is due to protein-protein interaction rather than protein-lipid interaction, as neither lipid micelles nor lipid monomers were found to be activating. Activation was strongest in the presence of high-density lipoproteins; very high-density lipoproteins were found to be non-activating. This is the first time that the ability of lipoproteins to induce phenoloxidase activity of hemocyanin has been demonstrated, thus adding novel aspects to the function of lipoproteins apart from their known role in nutrient supply.<p>

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a smoking-related, progressive lung disease that represents a substantial individual, societal and economic burden. Primary care professionals have an important role in healthcare provision for patients with COPD. In this position paper we summarise the current knowledge about, and management of patients with COPD. Next, we describe the role general practitioners and other primary care disciplines (should) have to prevent, diagnose and treat COPD. Finally, we explore differences in the way particular aspects of primary care COPD disease management are available or organised in a number of European countries, in order to identify barriers and provide examples of 'best practices' for optimal primary care management of patients with COPD.<p>

Cellular lipid droplets are the least studied and least understood cellular organelles in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Despite a significant body of research studying the physiology of lipid droplets it has not yet been possible to fully determine the composition of individual cellular lipid droplets. In this paper we use Raman spectroscopy on single cellular lipid droplets and least-squares fitting of pure fatty acid spectra to determine the composition of individual lipid droplets in cells after treatment with different ratios of oleic and palmitic acid. We validate the results of the Raman spectroscopy-based single lipid droplet analysis with results obtained by gas chromatography analysis of millions of cells, and find that our approach can accurately predict the relative amount of a specific fatty acid in the lipid droplet. Based on these results we show that the fatty acid composition in individual lipid droplets is on average similar to that of all lipid droplets found in the sample. Furthermore, we expand this approach to the investigation of the lipid composition in single cellular peroxisomes. We determine the location of cellular peroxisomes based on two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) imaging of peroxisomes labeled with the green fluorescent protein, and successive Raman spectroscopy of peroxisomes. We find that in some cases peroxisomes can produce a detectable CARS signal, and that the peroxisomal Raman spectra exhibit an oleic acid-like signature.<p>

The present study deals with low-volume amplification of short tandem repeats (STRs) for forensic DNA analysis. A chemically structured chip in microscopic slide format was used to amplify standard forensic casework samples in a 1-microL reaction volume primarily with the well-known and widely used PowerPlex kit and with other commercially available STR kits. Tests regarding sensitivity, mixture analysis, robustness, reproducibility, buffer composition and technical performance were carried out to check the usefulness of this amplification strategy. The results obtained show that low-volume amplification is a promising option in the forensic DNA typing toolbox. Restrictions to this method, which are strictly related to the kit and the respective buffer used, were found in low copy number (LCN) DNA typing, mixture analysis and technical performance. Problematic typing results included artefact alleles, increase in locus and heterozygote imbalance, allelic and locus dropout as well as increase of stutters, especially when amplifying less than 200-300 pg of DNA. In contrast, convincing advantages are a higher sensitivity, better amplification efficiency and the low cost factor of this method.<p>

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are present in environmental and tissue samples as complex mixtures of dioxin-like and non-dioxin-like congeners. Induction of cytochrome (CYP) P4501A1-catalyzed 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in H4IIE hepatoma cells is widely used as a simple in vitro bioassay for the dioxin receptor-mediated biological action of dioxin-like agonists. Since the results of the assay may be influenced indirectly by abundant non-dioxin-like PCBs, its application to the bioanalysis of complex PCB mixtures was studied. In the PCB mixtures Arochlor 1254 and Clophen A50, potent dioxin-like non-ortho PCBs and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) were found in minor amounts. However, the non-ortho PCBs accounted for most of the overall 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) equivalents based on EROD induction (EROD-TEQs). A comparison with a pattern of toxic equivalents (TEQs) based on toxic equivalency factors (I-TEFs) recently suggested in an international report revealed a much higher relative impact of mono-ortho PCBs on I-TEQs than on EROD-TEQs while total EROD-TEQs approximately coincided with total I-TEQs. It is concluded that the H4IIE bioassay is useful to assess total I-TEQs but does not reflect the individual contributions of PCB subgroups because of a higher evaluation of mono-ortho and di-ortho PCBs by I-TEFs. Based on individual EROD-TEFs, slightly higher mean EROD-TEQs than those calculated by assuming additive behaviour of single PCBs were obtained. This finding suggests a minor synergistic influence of non-dioxin-like PCBs on the inducing potency of dioxin-like agonists in the H4IIE bioassay.<p>

Antibacterial peptides are important for non-specific host defence in many animals. They have been extensively characterized from mammals, amphibians, insects and chelicerates but have not so far been found in crustaceans. Here we report the presence of several constitutive antibacterial proteins, active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, in the haemocytes of the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. These proteins have molecular masses of &gt; 70 kDa, approximately 45 kDa, approximately 14 kDa and 6.5 kDa. The 6.5 kDa peptide has been purified to homogeneity by Sep Pak C18 extraction, gel filtration and reverse-phase HPLC.

We report on the identification of novel epoxide products formed during the autoxidative transformation of 15 S-hydroxy- and 15 S-hydroperoxy-eicosatetra-5 Z,8 Z,11 Z,13 E-enoic acids (15 S-HETE and 15 S-HPETE). These epoxides account for about 20-30% of the polar compounds detected during the early stages of autoxidation. Their common structural features are retention of the original 15 S-hydroxy or 15 S-hydroperoxy moiety with epoxidation of the 11 Z or 13 E double bonds in the conjugated diene of the starting material. Four main epoxyalcohol isomers were characterized from the hydroxy fatty acid 15 S-HETE, comprising two pairs of diastereomers with either an 11,12- trans or 13,14- trans epoxide functionality. Four main epoxyhydroperoxides identified from 15 S-HPETE comprised two pairs with cis or trans epoxide configuration at the 11,12 position. To account for these transformations, we propose a mechanism involving peroxyl radical dependent dimerization or oligomerization of the fatty acid hydroxy or hydroperoxy derivatives into covalent intermediates resulting in intermolecular transfer of oxygen from the peroxyl radical to the epoxide group. Autoxidation of [ (18)O 2]-15 S-HPETE carrying an O-18 labeled hydroperoxide showed that the 11,12- cis epoxy oxygen of the epoxy-hydroperoxide product was enriched in the labeled oxygen, providing evidence that in part it was derived directly from the starting hydroperoxide and not from molecular oxygen. Thus, intermediate dimerization and possibly oligomerization of fatty acid peroxyl radicals provides a mechanism of epoxidation of fatty acid derivatives during lipid peroxidation and a potential route to other products including aldehydes formed via carbon chain cleavage.<p>

NarL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a putative nitrate response regulator that is involved in the regulation of anaerobic metabolism in this pathogen. The recombinant purified N-terminal signal receiver domain of NarL has been crystallized in space group C222(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 85.6, b = 90.0, c = 126.3 A, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement to 1.9 A resolution. Comparisons with related signal receiver domains show that the closest structural homologue is an uncharacterized protein from Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the nearest sequence homologue, NarL from Escherichia coli, displays larger differences in three-dimensional structure. The largest differences between the mycobacterial and E. coli NarL domains were found in the loop between beta3 and alpha3 in the proximity of the phosphorylation site. The active site in response regulators is similar to that of members of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) family, which also form a phospho-aspartyl intermediate. In NarL, the aspartic acid that acts as catalytic acid/base in several HAD enzymes is replaced by an arginine residue, which is less likely to participate in steps involving proton abstraction. This substitution may slow down the breakdown of the phospho-aspartyl anhydride and allow signalling beyond the timescales defined by a catalytic reaction intermediate.<p>

Schrader, H., et al. (2009). &quot;Reduced pancreatic volume and beta-cell area in patients with chronic pancreatitis.&quot; <u>Gastroenterology</u> <b>136</b>(2): 513-522.<p>
BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) often leads to the development of diabetes. To understand better this pathogenic mechanism, we investigated whether islet cell area and pancreatic volume are reduced in CP patients, islet cell turnover increases in CP patients, and islet cells are less vulnerable to apoptosis than acinar cells. METHODS: Pancreatic tissues from 43 patients with CP and 27 controls were examined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative morphometry. Pancreas volume was determined using abdominal computed tomography data. RESULTS: The pancreatic volumes were 64.9 +/- 4.3 cm(3) in CP patients and 82.3 +/- 6.7 cm(3) in controls (P = .035). beta-cell areas were 0.69% +/- 0.08% in CP patients and 0.97% +/- 0.08% in controls (P = .017), whereas alpha-cell areas did not differ between the groups (P = .47). There were no differences in the frequencies of replication among groups of alpha-cells, beta-cells, duct cells, or acinar cells nor were there differences in numbers of apoptotic alpha-cells or beta-cells between CP patients and controls. However, CP patients had an approximately 10-fold increase in numbers of apoptotic acinar cells compared with controls (P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Pancreatic volume was reduced by 21%, and the area comprising beta-cells was reduced by 29% in patients with CP. The lack of increased beta-cells turnover in CP patients, despite an approximately 10-fold increase in the number of apoptotic acinar cells, suggests that the damage to the pancreas is highly specific for the exocrine compartment and affects the endocrine islets to a lesser extent.<p>

The prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing. NASH confers an increased risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality with a substantial risk of developing liver cirrhosis. At present, there is no established medical treatment for NASH. The pathogenesis of NASH is incompletely understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that TNF-alpha may be involved in the pathogenesis of NASH by promoting liver inflammation, insulin resistance and hepatocyte apoptosis. Anti-TNF-alpha therapy has not been evaluated for the treatment of NASH. We report here on a patient with NASH who has experienced rapid normalization of liver biochemistry during treatment of an associated rheumatoid arthritis with the humanized anti-TNF-alpha antibody adalimumab. This observation suggests that pilot studies may be warranted to evaluate the role of adalimumab for the treatment of NASH.<p>

Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-induced necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN) requires complement participation in its pathogenesis. We tested the hypothesis that the anaphylatoxin C5a is pivotal to disease induction via the neutrophil C5a receptor (C5aR). Supernatants from ANCA-activated neutrophils activated the complement cascade in normal serum, producing C5a. This conditioned serum primed neutrophils for ANCA-induced respiratory burst; neutrophil C5aR blockade abrogated this priming, but C3aR blockade did not. Furthermore, recombinant C5a but not C3a dosage-dependently primed neutrophils for ANCA-induced respiratory burst. To test the role of C5aR in a model of NCGN, we immunized myeloperoxidase-deficient mice with myeloperoxidase, irradiated them, and transplanted bone marrow from wild-type mice or C5aR-deficient mice into them. All mice that received wild-type marrow (six of six) but only one of eight mice that received C5aR-deficient marrow developed NCGN (P &lt; 0.05). Albuminuria and neutrophil influx into glomeruli were also significantly attenuated in the mice that received C5aR-deficient marrow (P &lt; 0.05). In summary, C5a and the neutrophil C5aR may compose an amplification loop for ANCA-mediated neutrophil activation. The C5aR may provide a new therapeutic target for ANCA-induced necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis.<p>

We have previously shown that in AIDS patients a predominant species of infectious virus can be found which is not neutralized by homologous serum. The presence of the infectious virus was associated with the lack of type-specific antibody directed against the V3 domains of these virions. In contrast to this lack of V3-specific antibody, the other V3 domains of non-infectious virions were well recognized by antibody. To determine whether the lack of a V3-specific antibody response is due to a progressive loss of antibody during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, we monitored the anti-V3 antibody response in 90 patients over time. Anti-V3 antibodies were monitored by a V3-specific ELISA using 21 different V3 domains as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase (GST-V3) based upon sequences from 11 HIV-1 patient isolates and 10 sequences from an HIV-1 B subtype consensus-like GST-V3 expression library. This strictly heterologous screening showed a loss of V3-specific antibodies in 20 out of the 90 patients tested. To study the in vivo relevance of these findings we analysed V3 antibody loss in two patients. This strictly autologous antibody screening was performed based upon V3 sequences of the patients' cell-free virions. In both patients the loss of a V3-specific antibody could be detected in parallel to a decline of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the escape of a distinct V3 variant was shown to correlate closely with the loss of the V3-specific antibody.<p>

Schulze, E. D., et al. (1994). &quot;Nitrogen nutrition and isotope differences among life forms at the northern treeline of Alaska.&quot; <u>Oecologia</u> <b>100</b>(4): 406-412.<p>
Natural abundances of nitrogen isotopes, delta(15)N, indicate that, in the same habitat, Alaskan Picea glauca and P. mariana use a different soil nitrogen compartment from the evergreen shrub Vaccinium vitis-idaea or the deciduous grass Calamagrostis canadensis. The very low delta(15)N values (-7.7 per thousand) suggest that (1) Picea mainly uses inorganic nitrogen (probably mainly ammonium) or organic N in fresh litter, (2) Vaccinium (-4.3 per thousand) with its ericoid mycorrhizae uses more stable organic matter, and (3) Calamagrostis (+0.9 per thousand) exploits deeper soil horizons with higher delta(15)N values of soil N. We conclude that species limited by the same nutrient may coexist by drawing on different pools of soil N in a nutrient-deficient environment. The differences among life-forms decrease with increasing N availability. The different levels of delta(15)N are associated with different nitrogen concentrations in leaves, Picea having a lower N concentration (0.62 mmol g(-1)) than Vaccinium (0.98 mmol g(-1)) or Calamagrostis (1.33 mmol g(-1)). An extended vector analysis by Timmer and Armstrong (1987) suggests that N is the most limiting element for Picea in this habitat, causing needle yellowing at N concentrations below 0.5 mmol g(-1) or N contents below 2 mmol needle(-1). Increasing N supply had an exponential effect on twig and needle growth. Phosphorus, potassium and magnesium are at marginal supply, but no interaction between ammonium supply and needle Mg concentration could be detected. Calcium is in adequate supply on both calcareous and acidic soils. The results are compared with European conditions of excessive N supply from anthropogenic N depositions.<p>

For lack of sufficient human cartilage donors, chondrocytes isolated from various animal species are used for cartilage tissue engineering. The present study was undertaken to compare key features of cultured large animal and human articular chondrocytes of the knee joint. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from human, porcine, ovine and equine full thickness knee joint cartilage and investigated flow cytometrically for their proliferation rate. Synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins collagen type II, cartilage proteoglycans, collagen type I, fibronectin and cytoskeletal organization were studied in freshly isolated or passaged chondrocytes using immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Chondrocytes morphology, proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis and cytoskeleton assembly differed substantially between these species. Proliferation was higher in animal derived compared with human chondrocytes. All chondrocytes expressed a cartilage-specific extracellular matrix. However, after monolayer expansion, cartilage proteoglycan expression was barely detectable in equine chondrocytes whereby fibronectin and collagen type I deposition increased compared with porcine and human chondrocytes. Animal-derived chondrocytes developed more F-actin fibers during culturing than human chondrocytes. With respect to proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis, human chondrocytes shared more similarity with porcine than with ovine or equine chondrocytes. These interspecies differences in chondrocytes in vitro biology should be considered when using animal models.<p>

Schumann, F., et al. (2008). &quot;Salient features in gaze-aligned recordings of human visual input during free exploration of natural environments.&quot; <u>J Vis</u> <b>8</b>(14): 12 11-17.<p>
During free exploration, humans adjust their gaze by combining body, head, and eye movements. Laboratory experiments on the stimulus features driving gaze, however, typically focus on eye-in-head movements, use potentially biased stimuli, and restrict the field of view. Our novel wearable eye-tracking system (EyeSeeCam) overcomes these limitations. We recorded gaze- and head-centered videos of the visual input of observers freely exploring real-world environments (4 indoor, 8 outdoor), yielding approximately 10 h of data. Global power spectra reveal little difference between head- and gaze-centered recordings. Local stimulus features exhibit spatial biases in head-centered coordinates, which are environment-dependent, but consistent across observers. Eye-in-head movements center these biases in gaze-centered coordinates, leading to elevated &quot;salient&quot; features at center of gaze. This shows that central biases in image feature distributions in &quot;natural&quot; photographs are not a property of environments, but of stimuli already gaze-centered by the photographer. Further central biases in laboratory subjects' fixation distributions do not result from re-centering of the eyes but are an artifact of display restrictions. Hence, our findings demonstrate that the concept of feature &quot;saliency&quot; transfers from the laboratory to free exploration, but also highlight the importance of experiments with freely moving eyes, head, and body.<p>

Infants and toddlers are at high risk of neglect and maltreatment, as they are especially dependent on the care and the safeguard of their parents. Child protection can only succeed if early and preventive support for families at risk and their infants is provided. The project &quot;A good start to life&quot; helps to promote parental sensitive behaviour and care giving competence of parents in precarious life settings and in high risk situations and is aimed to prevent child neglect and abuse at an early age. A relevant prerequisite for child protection is interdisciplinary networking between the involved systems. The main focus of the project is the establishment of collaboration and network structures between the infant and youth welfare system and the health-care system and their services in eight communities in four states in Germany by using so-called round tables as communication platforms. Preliminary results of the round tables are reported in this article together with the results of the evaluation process.<p>

The patient who undergoes radical cystectomy requires a urinary diversion which will significantly impact on his everyday life. He will have to choose with his surgeon between three different types of diversions that enable urine to flow out of his body adequately. Hence, preoperative information is of paramount importance. The team providing it needs an iconographic support, unfortunately not readily available. In order to clearly explain to the patient the various types of diversions that he may benefit from, their everyday care and to have him/her share the experiences of previous patients, we have elaborated a multi-disciplinary information sequence associated with the creation of video support.<p>

The immunogenicity and safety of an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine were assessed in women aged 26-55 years and compared with women aged 15-25 years in a Phase III, non-randomised, open-label, age-stratified study. Overall the vaccine was well tolerated and 100% seropositivity was achieved 1 month after the third dose in all age groups. There was a high correlation between HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody levels (IgG) in cervicovaginal secretions and sera, regardless of age. The HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine induces a robust and persistent immune response in women &gt;26 years of age and generates antibodies that transudate through the cervix epithelium.<p>

The tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio glaucus, exhibits a female-limited polymorphism for Batesian mimicry; the Canadian tiger swallowtail, Papilio canadensis, lacks the mimetic (dark) form entirely. The species hybridize to a limited extent where their ranges overlap. Field collections and censuses indicate that mimetic females occur throughout the range of P. glaucus but at lowest frequencies in populations at the latitudinal edges of its geographic range such as the southernmost part of Florida and along the entire northern edge of its distribution from Massachusetts to Minnesota. Frequencies of mimetic females have remained relatively stable over time. Inheritance of the mimetic form is controlled primarily by two interacting sex-linked loci. The typical matrilineal pattern of inheritance in P. glaucus can be explained by polymorphism at a Y-linked locus, b. Analysis of P. glaucus x P. canadensis crosses has also revealed an X-linked locus, s, which controls the expression of the mimetic phenotype. The P. canadensis allele, s(can) , suppresses the mimetic phenotype in hybrid and backcross females. Results from more than 12 yr of rearing tiger swallowtails, including interspecies hybrids, indicate that the absence of mimetic P. canadensis females is due to both a high frequency of the &quot;suppressing&quot; allele s(can) and low frequency of the black-pigment-determining b + allele. The frequency of s(can) (or other suppressing alleles of s) in P. glaucus populations outside the hybrid zone is low. Some males heterozygous at the s locus and some suppressed mimetic females occur within the hybrid zone. A simple genetic model predicts the frequency of daughters that differ in phenotype from their mothers.<p>

The role of mesoscopic mass transport and re-adsorption effects in electrocatalytic reactions was investigated using the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as an example. The electrochemical measurements were performed on structurally well-defined nanostructured model electrodes under controlled transport conditions in a thin-layer flow cell. The electrodes consist of arrays of Pt ultra-microelectrodes (nanodisks) of defined size (diameter approximately 100 nm) separated on a planar glassy carbon (GC) substrate, which were fabricated employing hole-mask colloidal lithography (HCL). The measurements reveal a distinct variation in the ORR selectivity with Pt nanodisk density and with increasing electrolyte flow, showing a pronounced increase of the H2O2 yield, by up to 65%, when increasing the flow rate from 1 to 30 microL s(-1). These results are compared with previous findings and discussed in terms of a reaction model proposed recently (A. Schneider et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2008, 10, 1931), which includes (i) direct reduction to H2O on the Pt surface and (ii) additional H2O2 formation and desorption on both Pt and carbon surfaces and subsequent partial re-adsorption and further reduction of the H2O2 molecules on the Pt surface. The potential of model studies on structurally defined catalyst surfaces and under well-defined mass transport conditions in combination with simulations for the description of electrocatalytic reactions is discussed.<p>

PURPOSE: Calculation of conversion coefficients for the reconstruction of organ doses from entrance doses for chest radiographs of 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30-year-old patients in conventional pediatric radiology for the radiographic settings recommended by the German and European guidelines for quality management in diagnostic radiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The conversion coefficients for pediatric chest radiographs were calculated using the commercially available personal computer program PCXMC developed by the Finnish Centre for Radiation and Nuclear Safety (Sateilyturvakeskus STUK). PCXMC is a Monte Carlo program for computing organ and effective doses in about 40 organs of mathematical hermaphrodite phantom models describing patients of different ages. The possible clinical variation of beam collimation was taken into consideration by defining optimal and suboptimal radiation fields on the phantoms' surfaces. RESULTS: Conversion coefficients for the reconstruction of organ doses from measured entrance doses during chest radiographs for 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, and 30-year-old pediatric patients were presented. Conversion coefficients were calculated for the standard sagittal and lateral beam projections and the standard focus film distances of 100 cm, 115 cm, and 150 cm using the standard radiation qualities according to the recommendations of the German and European guidelines for quality management in diagnostic radiology. These conversion coefficients allow the reconstruction of the absorbed dose in about 40 organs and tissues of the human body for optimal and suboptimal radiation field collimations. CONCLUSION: The conversion coefficients presented in this paper may be used for organ dose assessments from entrance doses measured during chest radiographs of patients of all age groups with all beam collimations within optimal and suboptimal standard beam collimations. While the influence of the beam collimation on organ doses of organs localized near the center of the beam is expectedly low, the radiation exposure of organs and tissues near the boundaries of the radiation field can be considerably reduced by an optimal beam collimation. The conversion coefficients calculated for the STUK phantoms are in good conformity with values published for the GSF phantoms &quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;Golem&quot; and &quot;Visible Human&quot;.<p>

PURPOSE: Reconstruction of the entrance dose from radiographic settings and exposure data acquired during chest X-ray examinations of children of various age groups performed at Dr. von Hauner's Kinderspital (children's hospital of the university of Munich, DvHK), between 1976 and 2007. Comparison of these entrance doses with dose values published by other radiological departments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All relevant data of all X-ray examinations performed since 1976 at DvHK, in particular the individual radiographic settings and dose measurements (dose area product), were stored electronically in a database. After 30 years of data gathering, the database now covers 305,107 radiological examinations (radiographs and fluoroscopies), especially 119 150 chest radiographs of all age groups. With the computer program PADOS developed by the authors, a specific algorithm was created to calculate radiation doses from the database using the individual dose area product values and other known exposure parameters. RESULTS: The entrance dose values of the chest X-rays at DvHK were able to be reduced in the last 30 years by a factor of 2 to 3 depending on the patients' age group and the beam projection. In our sample, the measured dose values for chest X-rays were far below the reference dose levels set by the Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz (BfS) in 2003 and far below the entrance dose values reported by other radiological departments in Europe as well. Nevertheless, in the last years an increase in the entrance doses has been observed that easily corresponds to the introduction of a digital storage phosphor system in the department. CONCLUSION: Chest radiography is a frequently performed X-ray examination at a very low dose level. However, because of its frequency, it makes a notable contribution to the collective radiation risk of the population. Therefore, for the reduction of the collective radiation exposure, the optimization of the dose level required by chest X-rays continues to be of great importance. A reduction can be achieved with a consistent and simultaneous optimization of beam quality, exposure field and image processing system. Because of the statistically relevant number of analyzed cases, the entrance dose values presented in this paper can provide a basis for the definition of new reference dose levels.<p>

For lateral skull radiography the minimum required radiation patient exposure to ensure adequate image quality was determined for digital luminescence radiography (DLR) in comparison with a screen-film system (speed class 200). Radiographs were produced with a grid technique on conventional X-ray equipment. A real prepared female head including a true fracture above the pars petrosa ossis temporalis was imaged. The tube current-time product (mAs), and thus the surface entrance dose, was varied systematically. Surface entrance dose was measured with TLD-100 rods. Image quality was judged by experienced radiologists according to the criteria: visual resolution, mean optical density, contrast and perceptibility of specific bone structures. Surface entrance dose was reduced from 0.46 to 0.20 mGy by application of DLR instead of speed class 200 screen-film system without loss of diagnostic information in clinical routine. This corresponds to a dose reduction potential of 57% showing a good agreement with the dose reduction potential of 52% obtained in a previous study using the Alderson head phantom.<p>

Imazalil (IMA) is a widely used imidazole-antifungal pesticide and, therefore, a food contaminant. This compound is also used as a drug (enilconazole). As intestine is the first site of exposure to ingested drugs and pollutants, we have investigated the effects of IMA, at realistic intestinal concentrations, on xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and efflux pumps by using Caco-2 cells, as a validated in vitro model of the human intestinal absorptive epithelium. For comparison, other conazole fungicides, i.e. ketoconazole, propiconazole and tebuconazole, were also studied. IMA induced cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 activity to the same extent as benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cell-free aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding assay and reporter gene assay suggested that IMA is not an AhR-ligand, implying that IMA-mediated induction should involve an AhR-independent pathway. Moreover, IMA strongly inhibited the CYP3A4 activity in 1,25-vitamin D(3)-induced Caco-2 cells. The other fungicides had weak or nil effects on CYP activities. Study of the apical efflux pump activities revealed that ketoconazole inhibited both P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP-2) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), whereas IMA and other fungicides did not.

PCR products of 1.1 and 0.9 kb were generated using Cherax quadricarinatus genomic DNA in the first case, and hepatopancreas and ovary cDNAs in the second case. These PCR products were cloned and analyzed for nucleotide sequences. The 1.1 kb fragment was used as a probe for Northern hybridization, revealing a transcript of approximately 8 kb in both tissues. Results from both Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that the mRNA enconding the 3' end of the vitellogenin cDNA was present simultaneously in both hepatopancreas and ovary tissues in secondary vitellogenic at first maturation females, but was not detected in male hepatopancreas. The deduced amino acid sequences of Vitellogenin (Vg) cDNAs from ovary and hepatopancreas confirmed the existence at least two different Vg genes, and two different sites of synthesis.<p>

Isoenzymes 3-3 and 4-4 of the mu class glutathione S-transferases share 77% sequence identity but have distinctly different catalytic properties. Analysis of the crystal structure of isoenzyme 3-3 in complex with the diastereomeric products of the addition of GSH to phenanthrene 9,10-oxide (Ji, X., Johnson, W. W., Sesay, M. A., Dickert, L., Prasad, S. M., Ammon, H. L., Armstrong, R. N., and Gilliland, G. L. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 1043-1052) reveals that 3 residues that are in van der Waals contact with the xenobiotic portion of the product are different in the type 4 subunit. The three mutations, V9I, I111A, and S209A, have been introduced into isoenzyme 3-3 individually and in combination in an attempt to minimally reconstruct the active site of the enzyme to mimic the type 4 subunit in structure and function. The results suggest that the V9I mutation is an important determinant in the stereoselectivity of the enzyme toward enones and epoxides. The I111A mutation increases the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme toward para-substituted 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-ones (XPBO) as measured by kcat/KmXPBO but does not affect kcat. The S209A mutation has no effect on catalysis. The double and triple mutants V9I/I111A and V9I/I111A/S209A exhibit both a high stereoselectivity and high kcat/KmXPBO comparable to that of isoenzyme 4-4. Analysis of substituent effects on the kinetics and stereoselectivity of the enzyme toward the enone substrates suggests that the mechanistic bases for the catalytic behavior of the isoenzyme 4-4 and the reconstructed mutants are not identical. The results provide functional evidence for the catalytic importance of specific residues previously identified by x-ray crystallography.<p>

The thin-layer chromatography-flame ionization detection (TLC-FID) Iatroscan system is a technique which is still being evolved. Quantification with the TLC-FID system relies heavily on the accurate setting up and calibration of the instrument. An appreciation of the factors that influence the analysis can eliminate significant errors. At least a few of the numerous operating variables need to be fixed to obtain coherent results from different laboratories. Hydrogenation of the sample is recommended in order to improve quantification with the Iatroscan system. The improved reproducibility obtained with automatic sample spotters compared with manual spotting indicates that autosampling is highly advisable.<p>

Pesticides can modify invertebrate movement and feeding behaviour which could reduce predation in agroecosystems. Previous assays have exposed the spider Pardosa amentata (Clerck) to the synthetic pyrethroid cypermethrin and monitored prey items consumed in small containers (requiring very little movement to capture prey). The current study used larger arenas containing artificial 'vegetation' (a plastic analogue) to encourage spiders to hunt and capture prey. The period 24 h after exposure produced greatest variability in prey item consumption between treatments and was used to examine treatment effects. At this time, cypermethrin reduced prey consumption rates but these effects did not persist. Findings did not suggest that the presence of artificial vegetation in arenas modified prey consumption rates, which was consistent for individuals treated with cypermethrin and a control group. This is despite the majority of pesticide-treated individuals exhibiting both ataxia and paralysis of the hind legs (these effects persisting for a maximum of 3 and 6 days respectively). These findings were consistent for both sexes. Spider longevity under starvation conditions was not significantly reduced by cypermethrin exposure but overall females survived longer than males. The findings are discussed in the context of the arenas used and the ecology of this common predator.<p>

BACKGROUND: Tea is one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverages worldwide. However, the tea plant, Camellia sinensis, is difficult to culture in vitro, to transform, and has a large genome, rendering little genomic information available. Recent advances in large-scale RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provide a fast, cost-effective, and reliable approach to generate large expression datasets for functional genomic analysis, which is especially suitable for non-model species with un-sequenced genomes. RESULTS: Using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq, the transcriptome from poly (A)+ RNA of C. sinensis was analyzed at an unprecedented depth (2.59 gigabase pairs). Approximate 34.5 million reads were obtained, trimmed, and assembled into 127,094 unigenes, with an average length of 355 bp and an N50 of 506 bp, which consisted of 788 contig clusters and 126,306 singletons. This number of unigenes was 10-fold higher than existing C. sinensis sequences deposited in GenBank (as of August 2010). Sequence similarity analyses against six public databases (Uniprot, NR and COGs at NCBI, Pfam, InterPro and KEGG) found 55,088 unigenes that could be annotated with gene descriptions, conserved protein domains, or gene ontology terms. Some of the unigenes were assigned to putative metabolic pathways. Targeted searches using these annotations identified the majority of genes associated with several primary metabolic pathways and natural product pathways that are important to tea quality, such as flavonoid, theanine and caffeine biosynthesis pathways. Novel candidate genes of these secondary pathways were discovered. Comparisons with four previously prepared cDNA libraries revealed that this transcriptome dataset has both a high degree of consistency with previous EST data and an approximate 20 times increase in coverage. Thirteen unigenes related to theanine and flavonoid synthesis were validated. Their expression patterns in different organs of the tea plant were analyzed by RT-PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). CONCLUSIONS: An extensive transcriptome dataset has been obtained from the deep sequencing of tea plant. The coverage of the transcriptome is comprehensive enough to discover all known genes of several major metabolic pathways. This transcriptome dataset can serve as an important public information platform for gene expression, genomics, and functional genomic studies in C. sinensis.<p>

We present an extension of our earlier work on adaptive quantum wavepacket dynamics [B. Hartke, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2006, 8, 3627]. In this dynamically pruned basis representation the wavepacket is only stored at places where it has non-negligible contributions. Here we enhance the former 1D proof-of-principle implementation to higher dimensions and optimize it by a new basis set, interpolating Gaussians with collocation. As a further improvement the Tnum approach from Lauvergnat and Nauts [J. Chem. Phys., 2002, 116, 8560] was implemented, which in combination with our adaptive representation offers the possibility of calculating the whole Hamiltonian on-the-fly. For a two-dimensional artificial benchmark and a three-dimensional real-life test case, we show that a sparse matrix implementation of this approach saves memory compared to traditional basis representations and comes even close to the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform method. Thus we arrive at a quantum wavepacket dynamics implementation featuring several important black-box characteristics: it can treat arbitrary systems without code changes, it calculates the kinetic and potential part of the Hamiltonian on-the-fly, and it employs a basis that is automatically optimized for the ongoing wavepacket dynamics.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Emotional and behavioural alterations have been described in acromegalic patients. However, the nature and psychopathological value of these changes remained unclear. We examined whether acromegalic patients have an increased prevalence of comorbid DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Version) mental disorders in comparison to subjects with or without chronic somatic disorders. DESIGN/PATIENTS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Max-Planck Institute of Psychiatry and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. Eighty-one acromegalic patients were enrolled. Control subjects with (n = 3281) and without chronic somatic (n = 430) disorders were drawn from a representative sample of the German adult general population as part of the Mental Health Supplement of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey. Lifetime and 12-month prevalences of DSM-IV mental disorders were assessed with face-to-face interviews using the standardized German computer-assisted version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. RESULTS: Acromegalic patients had increased lifetime rates of affective disorders of 34.6% compared to 21.4% in the group with chronic somatic disorders (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.2) and to 11.1% in the group without chronic somatic disorders (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 2.3-8.7). Affective disorders that occurred significantly more often than in the control groups began during the putative period of already present GH excess. Higher rates of DSM-IV mental disorders were reported in those patients with additional treatment after surgery. CONCLUSION: Acromegaly is associated with an increased prevalence and a specific pattern of affective disorders. Greater emphasis on diagnosing and treatment of mental disorders in acromegalic patients might improve the disease management.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Although neuropsychiatric and morphological brain alterations in acromegalic patients have been described and a distinct disease personality is clinically suspected, this has never been systematically investigated. We examined whether patients with acromegaly showed an altered personality profile compared with patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas and healthy controls. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 70 acromegalic patients and 58 patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas were compared with 140 mentally healthy population controls, matched for age and gender. Personality traits were measured by standardized personality questionnaires (Eysenck personality questionnaire-RK and tridimensional personality questionnaire). RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, acromegalic patients described themselves as distinctly more harm avoidant and neurotic and presented themselves with high social conformity. On harm avoidant subscales, they reported more anticipatory worries and pessimism, higher fear of uncertainty, higher fatigability and asthenia. This personality pattern was not specific for acromegaly, but could similarly be observed in patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas. However, specific for patients with GH-producing adenomas was an even more reduced novelty-seeking behaviour, especially in terms of lower impulsiveness, compared with patients with non-functioning pituitary adenomas. CONCLUSION: Patients with pituitary adenomas show a distinct pattern of increased anxiety-related personality traits compared with the general population, potentially as a result of the pituitary lesion and/or associated hormonal dysregulations and comorbidities. Acromegaly is additionally associated with reduced impulsivity and novelty-seeking behaviour, which might affect patients' management and their quality of life.<p>

Nilaparvata lugens Stal, the Brown Planthopper (BPH), is a major pest in rice. The lycosid Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bosenberg &amp; Strand) and the linyphiid Atypena formosana (Oi) are the early dominant predators in irrigated rice. Later, predatory bugs, including the mirid Cyrtorhinus lividipennis Reuter, become dominant. In unsprayed rice, BPH numbers normally remain low. While P. pseudoannulata is known to be a key natural enemy of BPH, the contribution to BPH reduction by the smaller A. formosana is less well known. Due to the size difference, A. formosana may also be an intraguild prey of P. pseudoannulata. To investigate predation on BPH by the two spider species alone, together and in combination with C. lividipennis, two cage experiments were conducted, the first with adult spiders, the second with immature/unmated spiders. In the latter, spiders were introduced with a delay to allow a better establishment of C. lividipennis. In both experiments, BPH numbers were lowest in treatments with more than one predator species present. Intermediate BPH reduction was obtained with P. pseudoannulata followed by A. formosana and C. lividipennis. While P. pseudoannulata can prey upon large nymphs and adult BPH, A. formosana favour early instar BPH, leading to a more even control across instars in treatments with both spider species. Pardosa pseudoannulata numbers increased more with A. formosana or A. formosana and C. lividipennis present. In contrast, P. pseudoannulata reduced A. formosana and C. lividipennis numbers. The presence of C. lividipennis apparently lessened intraguild predation on A. formosana and may be an intraguild prey of A. formosana. Competition for prey may have added to the antagonistic interactions found. From a biological control perspective, the presence of both spiders in early rice is an advantage for the biological control of BPH in rice. In early rice, results show that A. formosana is an important predator of BPH and, like C. lividipennis, can complement control by P. pseudoannulata and serve as intraguild prey for the latter species.<p>

The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein transforms human lymphocytes and is critical for the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-induced adult T-cell leukaemia. In HTLV-transformed cells, Tax upregulates interleukin (IL)-13, a cytokine with proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions that is linked to leukaemogenesis. Tax-stimulated IL-13 is thought to result in autocrine stimulation of HTLV-infected cells and thus may be relevant to their growth. The causal transactivation of the IL-13 promoter by Tax is predominantly dependent on a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-binding P element. Here, it was shown that the isolated IL-13 Tax-responsive element (IL13TaxRE) was sufficient to mediate IL-13 transactivation by Tax and NFAT1. However, cyclosporin A, a specific NFAT inhibitor, revealed that Tax transactivation of IL13TaxRE or wild-type IL-13 promoter was independent of NFAT and that NFAT did not contribute to IL-13 upregulation in HTLV-transformed cells. By contrast, Tax stimulation was repressible by an efficient nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitor (IkBaDN), indicating the requirement for NF-kappaB. The capacity of NF-kappaB to stimulate IL13TaxRE was demonstrated by a strong response to NF-kappaB in reporter assays and by direct binding of NF-kappaB to IL13TaxRE. Thus, IL13TaxRE in the IL-13 promoter represents a dually active promoter element responsive to NF-kappaB and NFAT. Together, these results indicate that Tax causes IL-13 upregulation in HTLV-1-infected cells via NF-kappaB.<p>

We have purified a small size antimicrobial peptide, named gomesin, from the hemocytes of the unchallenged tarantula spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. Gomesin has a molecular mass of 2270.4 Da, with 18 amino acids, including a pyroglutamic acid as the N terminus, a C-terminal arginine alpha-amide, and four cysteine residues forming two disulfide bridges. This peptide shows marked sequence similarities to antimicrobial peptides from other arthropods such as tachyplesin and polyphemusin from horseshoe crabs and androctonin from scorpions. Interestingly, it also shows sequence similarities to protegrins, antimicrobial peptides from porcine leukocytes. Gomesin strongly affects bacterial growth, as well as the development of filamentous fungi and yeast. In addition, we showed that gomesin affects the viability of the parasite Leishmania amazonensis.<p>

SETTING: Combined 13-bedded intensive care/high dependency unit of a central London teaching hospital. RESULTS: The overall cost rose by 50%. Hidden costs such as infrastructure maintenance, capital assets, pathology and radiology services accounted for nearly a quarter of total expenditure. Pharmacy and supplies each accounted for some 10% of total expenditure whereas staff costs exceeded 50%. The cost of the intensive care section rose by 14% of 1149 pounds per patient day as increased bed occupancy offset increases in nurse: patient ratios and expenditure on consumables. However, the cost of the high dependency unit section rose by 87% to 437.83 pounds. This was due to a lower bed occupancy (through increased patient turnover), improved staffing ratios, and increased utilisation of equipment and supplies. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive care is an increasingly expensive speciality, the costs for which are rising over and above the rate of general inflation. Staff costs are by far the largest single item of expenditure. Large reductions in spending on drugs and consumables are unlikely to provide considerable savings on the total budget. Hidden costs account for a high proportion of the budget and should be taken into account when evaluating cost. The significantly lower cost of high dependency care should encourage studies into its cost-effectiveness.<p>

AIMS: Optic nerve sheath meningiomas typically present with unilateral visual deterioration. Here, a single centre's experience with radiotherapy aimed at local control and visual stabilisation is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The meningioma database within the Radiation Oncology Department, Prince of Wales Hospital was audited for patients whose meningiomas took origin from the optic nerve sheath. Excluded from this evaluation was any patient whose meningioma secondarily involved the optic nerve. Where vision was not a consideration, treatment was given by stereotactic radiosurgery for patients with retained vision. The remaining patients were treated by fractionated radiotherapy, predominately via a stereotactic approach. The main end points were: lack of radiological progression of the tumour and maintenance of preradiotherapy vision. RESULTS: There were 15 eligible patients, one patient with neurofibromatosis had bilateral optic nerve involvement; thus, 16 optic nerves were treated. Women (10) outnumbered men (five) and the age range was 7-74 years. One patient progressed outside the volume treated (for a geographical failure) with no infield progression. This patient became blind, was re-treated by stereotactic radiosurgery, had tumour control and vision improved. Thus, for 17 optic nerves (or part thereof) treated, all patients ultimately had local control (100%) with worsening of vision only occurring in one patient. No other late morbidity was present for any patient. CONCLUSION: Optic nerve sheath meningiomas have high local control rates and preservation of vision with radiotherapy.<p>

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a rapidly emerging technology that enhances radiation therapy delivery. It allows for tightly conformed treatment fields and accurate delivery even with moving targets in the body. SBRT currently is used most commonly in treatment of medically inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancers, as well as lung, liver, and spinal metastases. Studies to date are encouraging for increased local control with acceptable patient tolerance. This article familiarizes nurses with the use of this new technology and proposes the potential nursing role in maximizing patient preparation and follow-up care.<p>

(A) There are data showing beyond question a gender gap, with women living longer than men, especially in economically developed societies. There is greater male vulnerability to the major causes of human death. (B) In lower animals there are data suggesting a female survival advantage to adult life in many species, but the observations do not consider longevity or survival to an advanced age. (C) In laboratory rodents kept under controlled conditions the relationship of sex to longevity is variable, with males sometimes showing greater longevity than females and with life span being dependent on factors like breeding and diet. (D) Similar genetic and hormonal processes operate in humans and in non-human mammals including the genetic mechanism of sex determination, the hormonal consequences of sex determination, and the effects of hormones on processes which affect longevity such as cholesterol levels and immune functions. (E) Causes of death in humans and animals are different, and it seems unlikely, therefore, that the same mechanisms could be determinants of longevity in all mammalian species. (F) Human male and female longevity continue to change, and it is likely that the gender gap will narrow, with societal and medical changes in post-industrial societies reducing the male disadvantages in behaviour and in the handling of cholesterol. (G) It remains an important question whether part of the gender gap seen in humans is based on other differences in the basic biology of males and females.<p>

Eustachian tube dysfunction is a nearly universal complication of cleft palate, resulting in chronic ear disease and conductive hearing loss. Cleft palate repair is thought to result in recovery of eustachian tube function, but the length of time between repair and recovery of eustachian tube function is not known. Furthermore, the efficacy of tympanostomy tubes in the treatment of eustachian tube dysfunction and hearing sequelae has not been examined in a systematic way. To answer these questions, we performed a retrospective study that used serial audiometric data and tympanometry on 81 patients with cleft palates (162 ears), with follow-up ranging from 1 to 17.3 years. Average time to recovery of eustachian tube function was 6.0 years (range, 1.0 to 10.3 years) after cleft palate surgery. For children followed up for at least 6 years (longest follow-up, 17.3 years), 70% (67 of 85) had normal eustachian tube function at their last follow-up visit. Ears treated with Armstrong tympanostomy tubes required an average of 3.1 tubes per ear until recovery of eustachian tube function, whereas ears treated with Goode T tubes required only 1.1 tubes per ear (p &lt; 0.05). Hearing evaluation revealed that 67% of ears had abnormal hearing thresholds (&gt; 20 dB) before tympanostomy tube placement, whereas only 7.5% of ears demonstrated this loss after tube placement. Furthermore, more than 90% of ears maintained normal thresholds after recovery of eustachian tube function. These data indicate that most children with cleft palates eventually recover normal eustachian tube function after palatoplasty, but for the majority of children, this does not occur for many years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

In this study, we examine changes in fatty acid composition of polar and neutral lipids in gill, liver, and muscle of freshwater alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) after temperature challenges in the laboratory. Alewives experienced either a warm or cold challenge in which temperatures were raised or lowered 0.5 degrees C day(-1) over 4-6 weeks. In alewives experiencing the cold challenge, gill polar lipids showed evidence of significant remodeling, including decreases in palmitic acid and saturated fatty acids and increases in n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid. In alewives experiencing the warm challenge, we observed significant increases in saturated fatty acids (due mainly to increased palmitic acid) and decreases in polyunsaturated fatty acids in polar lipids of muscle and liver tissue. Fish that died during the cold challenge had significantly higher levels of palmitic acid in muscle polar lipids compared to fish that survived; fish that died during the warm challenge displayed complex changes in fatty acid composition. Based on theoretical considerations, the changes in polar lipids we observed during thermal acclimation are likely to promote appropriate membrane fluidity under each thermal regime. The increased incorporation of highly unsaturated fatty acids during cold acclimation could have significant physiological and ecological implications. In particular, since highly unsaturated fatty acids are typically scarce in freshwater food webs, dietary deficiencies in these essential fatty acids may be a significant factor in winter mortality of freshwater alewives.<p>

Energy balance is a fundamental requirement of stress adaptation and tolerance. We explore the links between metabolism, energy balance and stress tolerance using aquatic invertebrates as an example and demonstrate that using key parameters of energy balance (aerobic scope for growth, reproduction and activity; tissue energy status; metabolic rate depression; and compensatory onset of anaerobiosis) can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and their interactions and in predicting the whole-organism and population-level consequences of environmental stress. We argue that limitations of both the amount of available energy and the rates of its acquisition and metabolic conversions result in trade-offs between basal maintenance of a stressed organism and energy costs of fitness-related functions such as reproduction, development and growth and can set limit to the tolerance of a broad range of environmental stressors. The degree of stress-induced disturbance of energy balance delineates transition from moderate stress compatible with population persistence (pejus range) to extreme stress where only time-limited existence is possible (pessimum range). It also determines the predominant adaptive strategy of metabolic responses (energy compensation vs. conservation) that allows an organism to survive the disturbance. We propose that energy-related biomarkers can be used to determine the conditions when these metabolic transitions occur and thus predict ecological consequences of stress exposures. Bioenergetic considerations can also provide common denominator for integrating stress responses and predicting tolerance limits under the environmentally realistic scenarios when multiple and often variable stressors act simultaneously on an organism. Determination of bioenergetic sustainability at the organism's level (or lack thereof) has practical implications. It can help identify the habitats and/or conditions where a population can survive (even if at the cost of reduced reproduction and growth) and those that are incapable of supporting viable populations. Such an approach will assist in explaining and predicting the species' distribution limits in the face of the environmental change and informing the conservation efforts and resource management practices.<p>

Fluorescent analogs of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and sphingomyelin (SM) labeled with diphenylhexatrienylpropionic acid (DPH) were prepared and incorporated into the surface layer of human low density lipoprotein (LDL) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of DPH-PC and DPH-SM in both lipoprotein classes were carried out at different temperatures ranging from 20 to 37 degrees C. DPH-PC as well as DPH-SM were shown to reside in more rigid domains in Lp(a) than in LDL according to higher anisotropy values in Lp(a). In both LDL and Lp(a), DPH-PC experienced a more rigid environment than DPH-SM, suggesting different environments of PC and SM in the surface shell of the lipoproteins. Fluorescence lifetimes of the labeled lipoproteins were determined by phase and modulation fluorometry. We found bimodal Lorentzian distributions for the decay times of DPH-PC and DPH-SM in LDL and Lp(a). Lifetime distribution centers for labeled lipids were very similar except for DPH-PC in Lp(a) which was shifted to longer lifetimes, suggesting a less polar environment of PC in Lp(a) than in LDL. The distributional width of DPH-PC in Lp(a) was broader than in LDL. Accordingly, phosphatidylcholine must be localized in a more homogeneous environment in LDL as compared with Lp(a). On the other hand, no difference in distributional widths was observed for DPH-SM in both lipoproteins, showing that SM organization in Lp(a) is unaffected by apo(a). From the obtained fluorescence data we propose that apoproteins discriminate between the choline phospholipids and preferentially associate with phosphatidylcholine. This effect is enhanced in Lp(a) due to the presence of apolipoprotein(a).<p>

Periplaneta americana is the predominant cockroach (CR) species and a major source of indoor allergens in Thailand. Nevertheless, data on the nature and molecular characteristics of its allergenic components are rare. We conducted this study to identify and characterize the P. americana allergenic protein. A random heptapeptide phage display library and monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific to a the P. americana component previously shown to be an allergenic molecule were used to identify the MAb-bound mimotope and its phylogenic distribution. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, peptide mass fingerprinting, and BLAST search were used to identify the P. americana protein containing the MAb-specific epitope. We studied the allergenicity of the native protein using sera of CR-allergic Thai patients in immunoassays. The mimotope peptide that bound to the MAb specific to P. americana was LTPCRNK. The peptide has an 83-100% identity with proteins of Anopheles gambiae, notch homolog scalloped wings of Lucilia cuprina, delta protein of Apis mellifera; neu5Ac synthase and tyrosine phosphatase of Drosophila melanogaster, and a putative protein of Drosophila pseudoobscura. This finding implies that the mimotope-containing molecule of P. americana is a pan-insect protein. The MAb-bound protein of P. americana was shown to be arginine kinase that reacted to IgE in the sera of all of the CR-allergic Thai patients by immunoblotting, implying its high allergenicity. In conclusion, our results revealed that P. americana arginine kinase is a pan-insect protein and a major CR allergen for CR-allergic Thai patients.<p>

We conducted a cross-sectional study of Chagas disease in five endemic areas in Argentina, Bolivia, Honduras, and Mexico to estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibodies in pregnant women, and to assess the use of a rapid test (Chagas Stat-Pak) to screen for T. cruzi infection at the time of delivery. The prevalence of antibodies to T. cruzi measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in maternal blood was 5.5% (a range of 0.8-28.8% among the countries) in 2,495 women enrolled. Compared with ELISA in maternal blood samples, the Chagas Stat-Pak rapid test sensitivity and specificity in umbilical cord blood were 94.6% and 99.0%, respectively. These results show the ability for a rapid determination of the presence of T. cruzi-specific antibodies in umbilical cord blood as a pragmatic strategy to screen for infection in pregnant women.<p>

THE STRUCTURE OF THE VITELLINE NUCLEI OF LYCOSIDAE AND THOMISIDAE WAS DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS: Vitelline nuclei are constituted of two parts: (a) a peripheral layer (vitelline body cortex), and (b) a central core. The vitelline body cortex is demonstrated to be formed by many cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum among which mitochondria and Golgi elements are intermingled. The central core is made up mainly of a special type of body described under the name of &quot;capsulated body.&quot; Capsulated bodies comprise a capsular layer, limited by a membrane, and two central masses called &quot;geminated masses,&quot; each one limited by a double membrane. Irregular masses of closely packed vesicles are found in some cases among the capsulated bodies and free vesicles are present in large numbers. The optical properties of the vitelline body cortex compared with the electron microscope findings lead us to the concept that this layer is a &quot;composite body&quot; according to Weiner's theory.<p>

High density lipophorin (HDLp is the main lipoprotein found in resting insect hemolymph. It has, in general, two molecules of apolipoproteins: apoLp-I (250 kDa) and apoLp-II (80 kDa) and a variable lipid content which ranges from 35% to 59% (w/w). Diacylglycerols (DG), phospholipids (PL), and hydrocarbons (HC) are the main lipid components, whereas cholesterol and triacylglycerols are minor components. DG content varies from 7 to 30%, PL from 11 to 24%, and HC from 0 to 15%. In order to determine the relationship between the lipid composition and the arrangement of lipid and protein components in the lipoprotein particle, a density-composition structural model was designed. The model was established by means of 12 sets of data on lipophorin density-composition relationships, and model validity was determined throughout lipoprotein space- and surface-filling conditions. Despite the differences among the lipid compositions of lipophorins, it is concluded that there are several unifying structural restrictions that govern the molecular organization of lipophorins. Quantitative treatment of the model indicates that lipophorin structure is consistent with the following. 1) Spherical particles with a protein-rich outer layer of approximately 20-21 A thickness, comprised of proteins, phospholipids, cholesterol, and small amounts of DG, and a lipid-rich core composed of HC, TG, and almost all the lipophorin DG. 2) Apolipophorins have a lipid-embedded localization within the lipoprotein particle. They might represent one of the few examples of proteins containing beta-shift structure, exerting strong hydrophobic interaction and having a lipid-embedded localization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

Edible insects have recently been promoted as a source of protein and have a high nutrition value. Identification of allergens and cross-reactivity between Macrobrachium spp. and the field cricket (Gryllus bimaculatus) is necessary for food safety control and to assist in the diagnosis and therapy of allergy symptoms. Denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to separate proteins. Allergens were determined and identified by IgE-immunoblotting with pooled sera from prawn-allergic patients (n=16) and LC-MS/MS. Arginine kinase (AK) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were determined as the important allergens in muscle of Macrobrachium rosenbergii whereas, hemocyanin (HC) was identified as an allergen in Macrobrachium spp. The allergens in Macrobrachium lanchesteri were identified as AK and HC. In addition, hexamerin1B (HEX1B) was identified as a novel and specific allergen in G. bimaculatus. The important allergen in G. bimaculatus and Macrobrachium spp. is AK and was found to cross-react between both species.<p>

Malaria case management in Africa is characterized by presumptive treatment and substantial overtreatment. We evaluated an integrated team-based training program on malaria case management. Surveillance data 120 days before and after training were compared at eight health facilities in Uganda. After training, the proportion of patients with suspected malaria referred for blood smears increased from 38.3% to 54.6% (P=0.04) in persons&lt;5 years of age years and from 34.1% to 53.4% (P=0.02) in those&gt;or=5 years of age. The proportion of patients with negative blood smears prescribed antimalarial drugs decreased from 47.9% to 19.6% (P&lt;0.001) in persons&lt;5 years of age and from 38.8% to 15.6% (P&lt;0.001) in those&gt;or=5 years of age. Training did not improve the proportion of patients with positive blood smears prescribed antimalarial drugs, the proportion of patients prescribed appropriate antimalarial drugs, or the diagnostic accuracy of microscopy. Integrated team-based training may improve malaria case management and reduce the number of unnecessary antimalarial treatments.<p>

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Clinical experience and studies with experimental animal models indicate a synergistic hepatotoxic effect of dietary iron overload and chronic alcohol ingestion. In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying this synergism, we examined the hepatic levels of ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1, glutathione and malondialdehyde, and the effect of iron chelation with desferrioxamine, in livers from rats treated with iron and/or ethanol. METHODS: Animals received diets with or without 2.5-3% carbonyl iron for 6-9 weeks, followed by an ethanol-containing diet or a liquid control diet for 5-9 weeks. Desferrioxamine was administered subcutaneously with mini-osmotic pumps. Alanine aminotransferase activity in serum and hepatic contents of glutathione and malondialdehyde were determined. The hepatic level of cytochrome P450 2E1 was determined with Western Blotting using a specific polyclonal antibody. RESULTS: The combination of iron and alcohol led to a marked increase in serum alanine aminotransferase activity as compared with all other treatment groups, and iron chelation with desferrioxamine reversed these increases. Treatment with alcohol alone led to slightly increased aminotransferases compared with controls. The level of cytochrome P450 2E1 was significantly elevated in microsomes isolated from ethanol-treated rats, but neither additional iron supplementation nor desferrioxamine influenced this level significantly. Glutathione contents were increased in the livers of animals treated with iron and/or ethanol. Malondialdehyde values were increased in iron-treated animals, whereas neither ethanol nor desferrioxamine altered malondialdehyde levels significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The toxic effects exerted by the combination of iron overload and chronic ethanol feeding on rat liver are dependent on a pool of chelatable iron. The hepatic level of cytochrome P450 2E1 is markedly induced by ethanol but not further altered by iron overload. Neither increased lipid peroxidation nor depletion of hepatic glutathione levels can explain the synergistic hepatotoxic effects of iron and ethanol in this model.<p>

Prostaglandins and other eicosanoids are oxygenated metabolites of certain polyunsaturated fatty acids. These compounds are well known for their important actions in mammalian physiology and disease. Recent work has revealed the presence and biological actions of eicosanoids in insects and many other invertebrate animals. In insects, eicosanoids mediate cellular immunity to microbial and metazoan challenge. Notably, some infectious organisms secrete factors responsible for impairing host insect immune reactions by inhibiting biosynthesis of eicosanoids. Eicosanoids also act in insect reproductive biology, in ion transport physiology, and in fever response to infection as well as in protein exocytosis in tick salivary glands. Aside from ongoing actions in homeostasis, certain eicosanoid actions occur at crucial points in insect life histories, such as during infectious challenge and important events in reproduction.<p>

Inhibition of eicosanoid formation in larvae of the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta, using specific inhibitors of phospholipase A2, cyclooxygenase, and lipoxygenase, severely weakened the ability of larvae to clear the bacterium Serratia marscescens from their hemolymph. The reduced capability to remove bacteria is associated with increased mortality due to these bacteria. There is a dose-dependent relationship between the phospholipase A2 inhibitor dexamethasone and both the reduced bacterial clearance and increased larval mortality. The dexamethasone effects on larval survival were reversed by treatment with arachidonic acid. Maleic acid, a nonspecific antioxidant, did not interfere with the insects' ability to remove bacterial cells from hemolymph. The larvae were shown to contain all of the C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids necessary for eicosanoid biosynthesis and to be capable of converting radioactive arachidonic acid into several primary prostaglandins. These results strongly suggest that eicosanoids mediate transduction of bacterial infection signals into the complex of cellular and humoral responses that comprise invertebrate immunity.<p>

OBJECTIVE: Living-donor lobar lung transplantation offers an alternative for patients with a life expectancy of less than a few months. We report on our intermediate results with respect to recipient survival, complications, pulmonary function, and hemodynamic reserve. METHODS: Thirty-eight living-donor lobar lung transplants were performed in 27 adult and 10 pediatric patients for cystic fibrosis (32), pulmonary hypertension (two), pulmonary fibrosis (one), viral bronchiolitis (one), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (one), and posttransplantation obliterative bronchiolitis (one). Seventy-six donors underwent donor lobectomies. RESULTS: There were 14 deaths among the 37 patients, with an average follow-up of 14 months. Predominant cause of death was infection, consistent with the large percentage of patients with cystic fibrosis in our population. The overall incidence of rejection was 0.07 episodes/patient-month, representing 0.8 episodes/patient. Postoperative pulmonary function testing generally showed a steady improvement that plateaued by postoperative months 9 to 12. Fourteen patients who were followed up for at least 1 year underwent right heart catheterization; pressures and pulmonary vascular resistances were within normal ranges. Bronchiolitis obliterans was definitively diagnosed in three patients. Among the 76 donors, complications in the postoperative period included postpericardiotomy syndrome (three), atrial fibrillation (one), and surgical reexploration (three). CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these data support an expanded role for living-donor lobar lung transplantation. Our intermediate data are encouraging with respect to the functional outcome and survival of these critically ill patients, who would have died without this option.<p>

This study deals with the detailed electrochemistry and complete EPR-monitored titrations of flavodoxin II of Azotobacter vinelandii (ATCC 478). Since wild-type flavodoxin dimerises via intermolecular disulphide bond formation between Cys69 residues, Cys69 has been replaced by both an alanine and a serine residue. Redox properties of the C69A and C69S flavodoxin mutants were compared to those of wild-type flavodoxin. In the presence of the promotor neomycin, C69A and C69S flavodoxin showed a reversible response of the semiquinone/hydroquinone couple at the glassy carbon electrode. However, the addition of dithiothreitol proved to be necessary for the stabilisation of the wild-type flavodoxin response. EPR-monitored redox titrations of wild-type and C69A flavodoxin at high and low pH confirmed the redox potentials measured using cyclic voltammetry. The pH dependence of the semiquinone/hydroquinone redox potentials cannot be described using a model assuming one redox-linked pK. Instead, the presence of at least two redox-linked protonation sites is suggested: pKred.1 = 5.39 +/- 0.08, pKox = 7.29 +/- 0.14, and pKred.2 = 7.84 +/- 0.14 with Em.7 = -459 +/- 4 mV, and a constant redox potential at high pH of -485 +/- 4 mV. The dependence of the semiquinone/hydroquinone redox potential on temperature is -0.5 +/- 0.1 mV . K(-1), yielding delta H degrees = 28.6 +/- 1.5 kJ . mol(1) and delta S degrees = -50.0 +/- 6.2 J . mol(-1) . K(-1). No significant differences in redox properties of wild-type, C69A, and C69S flavodoxin were observed. The electrochemical data suggest that replacement of Cys69 in the vicinity of the FMN by either an alanine or a serine residue does not alter the dielectric properties and structure of A. vinelandii flavodoxin II.<p>

Pertussis toxin is an exotoxin from the bacterium Bordetella pertussis which is important the pathogenesis of whooping cough and the generation of a protective immune response. The diverse biological activities of the toxin depend on its ability to recognize carbohydrate-containing receptors on a wide variety of eukaryotic cells. We present here the crystal structure of pertussis toxin complexed with a soluble oligosaccharide from transferrin. Binding sites for the terminal sialic acid-galactose moiety are revealed on both subunits S2 and S3 of the B-oligomer. Identification of amino acid residues involved in receptor binding will improve the design of genetically inactivated toxins for use in new acellular whooping cough vaccines.<p>

LATE Ancillary Study Investigators. Late Assessment of Thrombolytic Efficacy.&quot; <u>Circulation</u> <b>90</b>(2): 746-752.<p>
BACKGROUND: Thrombolytic therapy reduces mortality after acute myocardial infarction, even when treatment is initiated relatively late after onset of symptoms. The mechanism underlying this survival benefit is incompletely understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospectively designed ancillary study of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of late thrombolytic therapy (LATE), the signal-averaged (SA) ECG was recorded before hospital discharge in an effort to assess the effect of thrombolytic therapy on arrhythmia substrate. Three hundred ten patients were enrolled at 23 participating sites; 160 patients received placebo, and 150 patients received recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rTPA) therapy 6 to 24 hours after onset of symptoms. Compared with placebo, rTPA tended to reduce the frequency of SAECG abnormality (filtered QRS duration &gt; 120 milliseconds) by 37% (95% CI, -64%, +6%; P = .087) and the filtered QRS duration (105.7 +/- 13.8 versus 108.8 +/- 14.6 milliseconds, P = .05). In the prespecified subgroup of 185 patients with ST elevation on the qualifying ECG, rTPA resulted in a 52% reduction (95% CI, 4% to 77%, P = .011) of SAECG abnormality and a shorter filtered QRS duration (105.7 +/- 10.9 versus 110.7 +/- 15.9 milliseconds, P = .01). No benefit was seen in patients without ST elevation on ECG. CONCLUSIONS: Late thrombolytic therapy produced a more stable electrical substrate, which probably represents an important mechanism of mortality benefit.<p>

Persistent symptoms after cholecystectomy are common, occurring in up to 40 per cent of patients. Severe pain persists in 10 per cent of cases. A total of 450 patients were studied, 200 after open cholecystectomy and 250 after the laparoscopic operation. Patient notes were reviewed and a postal questionnaire was circulated. Responses were obtained from 155 patients (77.5 per cent) undergoing open cholecystectomy and 205 (82.0 per cent) having the laparoscopic operation. Mean (s.d.) follow-up was 32(23) months after open cholecystectomy and 15(7) months after the laparoscopic procedure. Right upper quadrant pain was more common after open cholecystectomy (9.7 versus 3.4 per cent, P &lt; 0.05). Indigestion and heartburn were equally prevalent in the two groups. Some 59.4 per cent of patients were free from symptoms after open cholecystectomy compared with 63.4 per cent following the laparoscopic operation; there was symptomatic improvement in 30.3 and 31.7 per cent respectively. Symptoms were the same or worse in 10.3 per cent of patients after open cholecystectomy compared with 4.9 per cent after the laparoscopic operation (P &lt; 0.05). Patients report significantly less right upper quadrant pain after laparoscopic than after open cholecystectomy.<p>

Continuous cultivation of murine L cells infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus strain Armstrong leads to production of L(Arm) cells, which produce a predominantly cell-associated attenuated variant, the L(Arm) virus. The relatively few infectious particles that are released have lost the ability to form plaques on L cells and to cause illness in mice even if inoculated intracerebrally. Based on equal protein M(r)s, antigenicity and protein kinase activity, essentially identical results were obtained for the purified Armstrong and L(Arm) viruses. There was also no difference in production and release of particles with the potential to cause homologous interference. Such particles consisted of two types, one of which was highly susceptible to u.v.-irradiation, the other was highly resistant. In the case of the L(Arm) virus interfering particles, it appears that the u.v.-irradiation-susceptible forms represented infectious virus. Purified L(Arm) virus particles contained considerable quantities of subgenomic forms of (small) S- and (large) L-RNA and their complementary counterparts, which all appeared to be replicated autonomously in an unenriched manner.<p>

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiofrequency-catheter-ablation of atrial fibrillation is now commonly performed. Aim of this short review is to summarize questions and uncertainties concerning radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation with respect to therapeutic mechanisms, long-term efficacy and stroke-prevention. RESULTS: The majority of atrial fibrillation patients is too old for radiofrequency ablation. Candidates for radiofrequency ablation belong to a subgroup with a low embolic risk. The radiofrequency ablation procedure itself may increase the embolic risk, and at present it is uncertain how long this embolic risk persists after the procedure. CONCLUSION: We doubt if radiofrequency ablation prevents embolism in atrial fibrillation.<p>

We describe here for the first time the development of mechanosensory organs in a chelicerate, the spider Cupiennius salei. It has been shown previously that the number of external sense organs increases with each moult. While stage 1 larvae do not have any external sensory structures, stage 2 larvae show a stereotyped pattern of touch sensitive 'tactile hairs' on their legs. We show that these mechanosensory organs develop during embryogenesis. In contrast to insects, groups of sensory precursors are recruited from the leg epithelium, rather than single sensory organ progenitors. The groups increase by proliferation, and neural cells delaminate from the cluster, which migrate away to occupy a position proximal to the accessory cells of the sense organ. In addition, we describe the development of putative internal sense organs, which do not differentiate until larval stage 2. We show by RNA interference that, similar to Drosophila, proneural genes are responsible for the formation and subtype identity of sensory organs. Furthermore, we demonstrate an additional function for proneural genes in the coordinated invagination and migration of neural cells during sensory organ formation in the spider.<p>

Anorexia nervosa is associated with multiple endocrine abnormalities. Hypothalamic neuropeptides and monoamines are involved in the regulation of human appetite, and they are changed in several ways in anorexia nervosa. But it remains to be clarified whether these alterations are secondary or etiologic. Feeding behaviour in anorexia nervosa is characterised by a strong ambivalence and not by loss of appetite. Hypothalamic amenorrhea is a diagnostic criterion, and is not only secondary as it often precedes the weight loss and persists for a long time after weight and motor activity have returned to normal. Hypersecretion of corticotropin releasing hormone seems to be secondary to starvation, but at the same time it may keep up and intensify the anorexia, physical hyperactivity and amenorrhea. Low production of insulinlike growth factor-I and high growth hormone secretion reflects the nutritional deprivation. In conclusion most of the neuroendocrine abnormalities are secondary to weight loss, but some of them seem to participate in a circulus vitiosus and maintain the emaciated state.<p>

Remodeling of the vessel wall after balloon angioplasty injury is incompletely understood, and in particular, the role of extracellular matrix synthesis in restenosis has received little attention. The objective of the present study was to determine the sequence of changes in collagen, elastin, and proteoglycan synthesis and content after balloon injury and to relate these changes to growth of the intimal lesions and extent of cell proliferation. In a double-injury non-cholesterol-fed model, right iliac arterial lesions in 43 rabbits were treated with balloon angioplasty, and the rabbits were killed at five time points ranging from immediate to 12 weeks. Vessel wall collagen and elastin content and synthesis were measured after incubation with 14C-proline and separation with a cyanogen bromide extraction procedure. Sulfated glycosaminoglycan synthesis was measured after incubation with [35S]sulfate, papain digestion, and ethanol precipitation. Continuous in vivo infusion of bromodeoxyuridine (96 hours) was used to assess cell proliferation. The intimal area significantly increased from 0.27 +/- 0.08 to 0.73 +/- 0.11 mm2 between 0 and 12 weeks. Intimal and medial cell proliferation were modest and peaked at 1 week (labeling indexes of 4.8% and 3.0%, respectively) and then markedly declined by 2 weeks. Significant increases in collagen, elastin, and proteoglycan synthesis, up to 4 to 10 times above control nondamaged contralateral iliac arteries, were noted at 1, 2, and 4 weeks. These increases in synthesis were accompanied by significant increases in collagen and elastin content (by approximately 35%) that coincided with the temporal increase in cross-sectional area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term success of tantalum stents implanted in iliac artery lesions and to determine potential predictive factors of early and late stent failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 289 patients, flexible tantalum stents were implanted in iliac artery stenoses (n - 223) or occlusions (n - 66). Early and late stent failures were evaluated at 1-79 months (mean, 23 months). Four risk factors were evaluated: lesion type (occlusion vs stenosis), lesion location (common vs external iliac artery), lesion length (&lt; 4 vs &gt; 4 cm), and quality of runoff (good vs poor). RESULTS: The frequency of early stent thrombosis was significantly (P &lt; .001) higher in occlusions (15.2%) versus stenoses (2.7%), in external (12.8%) versus common (1.1%) iliac arteries, in long (16.7%) versus short (0.5%) lesions, and in poor (14.0%) versus good (2.1%) runoff. At multivariate analysis, runoff and location were influencing factors. Primary patency rates at 3 and 5 years were 85% and 70%, respectively, for all stents. Three-year patency rates were significantly higher in short (88%) versus long (63%) lesions and in stenoses (92%) versus occlusions (63%). At multivariate analysis, lesion length was the only predictive factor for 3-year stent patency. CONCLUSION: Stent implantation offers valuable long-term treatment for atherosclerotic iliac artery disease. Success can be predicted on the basis of risk factors.<p>

The gene for arginine kinase (AK; EC 2.7.3.3) from the horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, was cloned and the complete cDNA sequence was determined. An open reading frame with 1071 nucleotides was detected that encodes a 357 amino-acid protein with a calculated M(r) of 40,238. The coding transcript is flanked by 13 and 512 nucleotides of 5' and 3' untranslated regions, respectively. The deduced amino-acid sequence of Limulus AK displays extensive similarity to other arginine kinases, vertebrate and invertebrate creatine kinases (CK) and a glycocyamine kinase (GK). Consensus AK and consensus CK sequences, as well as a GK sequence, were compared to CK peptide regions containing residues presumed to be important in catalysis and/or located in close proximity to the active site. Our comparisons revealed some inconsistencies with hypothesized roles of particular residues in catalytic function.<p>

Ecdysteroids are the molting hormones in Crustacea, as in other arthropods. They also subserve functions in the control of reproduction and embryogenesis. The available evidence indicate that the ecdysteroids are sequestered into the ovary by binding to yolk precursor proteins. Steroidogenic ability of the ovary is yet to be demonstrated in Crustacea. Despite several investigations, the role of ecdysteroids in oocyte maturation is not fully known. However, the embryonic ecdysteroids undergo significant fluctuation, correlated to specific developmental stages, including the secretion of embryonic envelopes and cuticle. Ecdysteroid metabolism in the eggs seems to be active throughout embryogenesis inasmuch as the free ecdysteroids are rapidly converted into conjugates, and vice versa; in addition to their inactivation into excretory ecdysteroidic acids. Eyestalk neuropeptides such as molt inhibiting hormones have a dominant role on the ecdysteroid synthesis by Y-organ, although recent evidence suggests a stimulatory role for yet another endocrine gland, the mandibular organ on Y-organ synthesis.<p>

This study was designed to explore whether the basal adrenocortical activity is related with pain-related coping, nonverbal pain behavior, depressive mood, and fatigue in patients with acute and chronic nonspecific low back pain. 19 patients with acute low back pain (ALBP) and 24 with chronic low back pain (CLBP) participated in the study. The adrenocortical activity was assessed through the cortisol awakening response. All participants provided five saliva samples (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60min after waking) on two consecutive days off work. Pain-related coping [fear-avoidance coping (FAC) and endurance coping (EC)], nonverbal pain behavior (NPB), depressive mood, and fatigue were assessed through questionnaires. Among ALPB patients, EC was negatively associated with the cortisol release, whereas fatigue was positively associated with it. Among CLBP patients, FAC, NPB, depressive mood, and fatigue were negatively associated with the cortisol awakening response, whereas EC tended to be positively associated with it. The results indicate that pain-related coping strategies which are expected to be successful appear to lower the adrenocortical activity among ALBP patients, whereas affective distress may enhance the level of cortisol in this group. Among CLBP patients, long-term maladaptive coping strategies might contribute to hypocortisolism.<p>

The objective of this study was to investigate the acceptance of structured diagnostic interviews in clinical practice, as well as research, settings. Using the Diagnostisches Interview bei Psychischen Storungen (the modified and extended German version of the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV), 10 certified interviewers conducted 183 structured interviews in different inpatient, outpatient, and research settings in Switzerland and Germany. After each interview, patients and interviewers filled out a questionnaire asking for their evaluation of the interview. Patients' and interviewers' reactions to the interview were highly positive. On a scale measuring overall satisfaction with the interview (0=not at all satisfied, 100=totally satisfied) the mean patient rating was 86.55 (SD=13.18), and the mean interviewer rating was 85.82 (SD=12.84). The procedure used by the interviewer was rated by 142 (78.5%) patients as being helpful, and 176 (96.7%) rated the relationship as being positive. Less than 16% of the interviews were described as exhausting by the patients and interviewers. A majority of the interviewers (92.6%) indicated that during the interview they could respond adequately to the patient. The results of this study indicate that structured diagnostic interviews are highly accepted by interviewers and patients in a variety of settings. These findings, together with the existing evidence of the reliability and validity of structured interviews, should encourage their use in the diagnostic process, in outpatient and inpatient clinical settings as well as in research studies.<p>

The objective of this study was to determine whether a single or repeated injection of methotrexate (MTX) to treat ectopic pregnancy results in either teratogenicity or other bad obstetric outcome in the pregnancy that shortly follows treatment. Data were retrieved from the medical records of 314 women treated with MTX for ectopic pregnancy in our institute (2000-2006) included age, MTX dosage, interval between last MTX treatment to conception, results of ultrasonographic follow-up of the subsequent pregnancy, triple test, karyotype testing, pregnancy outcome, and newborn weight and Apgar score. A logistic regression model based on pregnancy outcome as the dependent variable and interval since last MTX treatment as the independent variable estimated the odds ratio for the safety of conception occurring shortly after the treatment. Complete information was obtained for 125 pregnancies. Forty-five pregnancies occurred within 6 months (mean 3.6+/-1.7) after the last MTX treatment. The outcome of these pregnancies was compared with that of 80 pregnancies which occurred &gt; or =6 months (mean 23.6+/-14.7) after the last MTX treatment. The fetal malformation and adverse outcome rates for both groups were similar (odds ratio 1.003, 95% CI 0.98-1.02). According to a logistic regression analysis, the interval between the last MTX treatment for ectopic pregnancy had no effect on the outcome of the pregnancy that shortly followed it. The results of this study support the notion that conceiving within the first 6 months after treatment with MTX for ectopic pregnancy is safe and not associated with any increase in the examined adverse pregnancy outcome parameters.<p>

Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) are mostly CD8 single positive T cells. IEL with a TCR-alpha(beta) that are CD8 single positive are absent from beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient mice, consistent with the idea that these IEL, like other TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD8+ T cells, require class I molecules for positive selection. In contrast, here we show that substantial numbers of TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD8 single positive IEL are present in mice deficient for the transporter associated with Ag processing 1 (TAP 1) gene, although T cells with this phenotype are absent from thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes of these same mice. The majority of TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD8 single positive IEL in TAP-deficient mice expresses CD8 molecules composed of alpha(alpha) homodimers and they express a diverse set of V(beta) gene segments. In addition, the number of TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD4/CD8 double positive IEL is decreased in beta(2)m-deficient mice but not in TAP-deficient mice. The dependence of the two TCR-alpha(beta)+ IEL populations that express CD8alpha(alpha) homodimers on beta(2)m as opposed to TAP molecules is striking. It suggests that TAP-independent but beta(2)m-requiring nonclassical class I molecules expressed by cells in the intestine, such as the thymus leukemia Ag and CD1, could play a pivotal role in the development and/or the accumulation of major subpopulations of TCR-alpha(beta)+ IEL.<p>

Oxytocin is synthesized and released in the heart and vasculature, tissues that also express oxytocin receptors. Although it has been established this intrinsic cardiovascular oxytocin system is important in normal homeostatic cardiac and vascular regulation, a role for this system in cardiovascular pathophysiology has not been investigated. The current study examined the influence of oxytocin on mechanisms in atherogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in cultured human vascular cells, THP-1 monocytes, and macrophages. Oxytocin receptor protein and mRNA expression, NADPH-dependent superoxide activity, and interleukin-6 secretion were measured. Results demonstrated oxytocin receptor protein and mRNA in THP-1 monocytes and macrophages. Incubation of cells at physiological levels of oxytocin significantly decreased basal and stimulated NADPH-dependent superoxide activity in vascular cells, monocytes, and macrophages by 24-48%. Oxytocin also attenuated interleukin-6 secretion from stimulated THP-1 macrophages and endothelial cells by 56 and 26%, respectively. These findings suggest that oxytocin attenuates vascular oxidative stress and inflammation, two important pathophysiological processes in atherosclerosis. The fact that oxytocin receptors are found in monocytes and macrophages, and oxytocin decreases both superoxide production and release of a proinflammatory cytokine from these cells, suggests a potentially larger role for oxytocin in the attenuation of disease.<p>

Reproductive processes are inhibited by deficits in the availability of metabolic fuels, and this inhibition increases the chances of survival during energetic challenges and optimizes reproductive success by delaying energetically costly processes until fuels become available. The mechanisms that link energy availability to reproduction are unknown, and thus, in this study we tested the hypothesis that estrous cycles are most sensitive to sensory signals from bulk intake and gastric fill as opposed to signals from caloric intake or the availability of intracellular oxidizable fuels. The caloric content of a standard laboratory chow diet was diluted by 25, 50, or 75% with the largely indigestible fiber, cellulose, and fed to food-deprived, female hamsters throughout day 2 of the estrous cycle (ovulation and estrous behavior normally occur on day 4). The bulk intake/gastric fill hypothesis was not supported because bulk intake increased the more the diet was diluted, whereas the frequency of hamsters showing normal 4-day estrous cycles decreased with diet dilution, along with decreases in caloric intake and in plasma insulin concentrations. Rate of gastric emptying did not change significantly with diet dilution. Although consumption of a diluted diet significantly lengthened the estrous cycle, it did not affect incidence of pregnancy, litter size or pup weight. Thus, when hamsters ingest sufficient energy to support estrous behavior, they fully recover reproductive potential. In summary, neither bulk intake nor gastric fill provides critical signals necessary for reproduction, consistent with the idea that reproduction is primarily responsive fuel availability.<p>

Membranes with a high content of polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) facilitate formation of metarhodopsin-II (M(II)), the photointermediate of bovine rhodopsin that activates the G protein transducin. We determined whether M(II)-formation is quantitatively linked to the elastic properties of PEs. Curvature elasticity of monolayers of the polyunsaturated lipids 18 : 0-22 : 6(n - 3)PE, 18 : 0-22 : 5(n)- 6PE and the model lipid 18 : 1(n - 9)-18 : 1,(n- 9)PE were investigated in the inverse hexagonal phase. All three lipids form lipid monolayers with rather low spontaneous radii of curvature of 26-28 angstroms. In membranes, all three PEs generate high negative curvature elastic stress that shifts the equilibrium of MI(I)/M(II) photointermediates of rhodopsin towards M(II) formation.<p>

A method is described using counterflow centrifugation elutriation to isolate macrophages from murine liver and spleen. In this study three, size fractionated, macrophage populations were collected. Isolation resulted in a high yield of pure Kupffer cells (total of 10 x 10(6) /g liver) and enrichment of splenic macrophages to 20%. In addition to standard methods such as non-specific esterase staining, the isolated macrophages were also characterized by flow cytometry using specific monoclonal antibodies. In addition, a rapid flow cytometry method was introduced to determine the percentage of macrophages based on autofluorescence. A strong correlation was found between the percentages of macrophages found by non-specific esterase staining and autofluorescence. Functional tests revealed differences between the isolated macrophages in terms of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production, oxygen metabolism and the production of nitric oxide. However, no significant differences in phagocytic activity was observed between the fractions. After two weeks of culture without the addition of antibiotics the cells still exhibited the above mentioned functions.<p>

The present topical review focuses on recent advances concerning an intriguing phenomenon in condensed matter physics, the scattering of conduction electrons at the localized spin of a magnetic impurity: the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic signatures of this effect have been observed in the past by high-resolution photoemission which, however, has the drawback of averaging over a typical surface area of 1 mm(2). By combining the atomic-scale spatial resolution of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with an energy resolution of a few tens of microeV achievable nowadays in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and by exposing the magnetic adatom to external magnetic fields, our understanding of the interaction of a single magnetic impurity with the conduction electrons of the nonmagnetic host has been considerably deepened. New insight has emerged by taking advantage of quantum size effects in the metallic support and by decoupling the magnetic adatom from the supporting host metal, for instance by embedding it inside a molecule or by separating it by an ultrathin insulating film from the metal surface. In this way, Kondo resonances and Kondo temperatures can be tailored and manipulated by changing the local density of states of the environment. In the weak coupling limit between a Kondo impurity and a superconductor only a convolution of tip and sample DOS is observed while for strongly coupled systems midgap states appear, indicating superconducting pair breaking. Magnetic impurities with co-adsorbed hydrogen on metallic surfaces show pseudo-Kondo resonances owing to very low-energy vibrational excitations detected by inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. One of the most recent achievements in the field has been the clarification of the role of magnetic anisotropy in the Kondo effect for localized spin systems with a spin larger than S = 1/2.<p>

Hemocyanin is present throughout the decapod crustacean's life, usually as one-hexamer and two-hexamer oligomers. Hemocyanins of some decapod crustaceans undergo changes in subunit composition and oxygen affinity during development. Maternal hemocyanin is taken up from the hemolymph via endocytosis by the oocyte. Embryo hemocyanin differs in subunit composition from hemocyanin of oocyte and adult crab and may represent the onset of hemocyanin synthesis. Complex changes in expression of hemocyanin subunits occur through megalopa and early juvenile stages of the crab Cancer magister, culminating in the pattern of adult hemocyanin. The influences of food availability and temperature on development, growth and hemocyanin ontogeny in early juvenile C. magister have been studied. Crabs were raised in warm or cold sea water and fed high or low levels of food for 6 months. While intermolt period was shorter in crabs fed high food levels, especially those raised in warm water, crabs reared in cold water with high food levels attained the largest sizes. Thus increased food availability affects growth more than increased temperature. Adult hemocyanin appeared at about the same number of weeks after the start of the experiment for crabs in the warm water/high food, warm water/low food and cold water/high food groups, even though warm water/low food crabs had molted fewer times. Crabs in the cold water/low food group expressed adult hemocyanin much later than the other groups. Molt stage and maturation from juvenile to adult are not absolutely coupled, and food availability has a greater influence than temperature on hemocyanin ontogeny.<p>

Arthropod phenoloxidases catalyze the melanization and sclerotization of the new postmolt exoskeleton, and they function in the immune response. Hemocyanin, phylogenetically related to phenoloxidase, can function as a phenoloxidase under certain conditions. We investigated the relative contributions of hemocyte phenoloxidase and hemocyanin in the brachyuran crab Cancer magister, using the physiological ratio at which they occur in the hemolymph, and found that hemocyte phenoloxidase has higher activity. They both convert diphenols to o-quinones, but only the hemocyte phenoloxidase is able to catalyze the conversion of monophenols to diphenols. The quaternary structure of hemocyanin affects its reactivity as phenoloxidase. We suggest that prophenoloxidase is released from hemocytes and moves across epidermis into new exoskeleton during premolt and is activated in early postmolt. In addition to functional studies, we have determined the complete cDNA sequence of C. magister hemocyte prophenoloxidase and partial sequences from the branchiopods Artemia franciscana and Triops longicaudatus. We also sequenced C. magister cryptocyanin 2 and a hemocyanin from the amphipod Cyamus scammoni and used these and other members of the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily for phylogenetic analyses. The phylogenies presented here are consistent with the possibility that a common ancestral molecule had both phenoloxidase and reversible oxygen-binding capabilities.<p>

This study evaluated the time course of caspase activation in selectively vulnerable brain areas (hippocampus, nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT), cortex and striatum) following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after global cerebral ischemia due to cardiac arrest (CA) in rats. Caspases are well known to play a crucial role in the apoptotic cascade and inflammatory syndromes and, therefore, represent potential therapeutic postischemic targets. Given the delayed neurodegeneration following CA, it is highly important to study the time course of caspase activation in regard to therapeutic interventions after CA. To assess caspase activity, in situ staining was applied to detect general caspase activity at 6h, 3d and 7d and caspase-3 activity at 3d after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). For detection of neuronal apoptosis, TUNEL staining was applied at 7d after ROSC. Distinct patterns of early caspase activation were observed at 6h and 3d in the NRT and striatum and of late activation at 7d in the hippocampal CA-1 sector. General caspase and caspase-3 activity correlated strongly at 3d after ROSC in all areas studied. At 7d, the TUNEL-positive neuron counts in the hippocampal CA-1 sector correlated strongly with caspase activation. In conclusion, general caspase and caspase-3 activity after 6 min of CA and the delayed occurrence of TUNEL-positive neurons strongly indicate that neuronal degeneration after CA is at least strongly associated with apoptosis. Therefore, postischemic antiapoptotic interventions might offer potential future therapeutic opportunities global cerebral ischemia due to CA.<p>

BACKGROUND: Magnesium seeding of haemangiomas is a form of treatment already successfully used in 1900. PATIENT: We report about a male infant with a haemangioma of the left temporal region, underlid and orbit. Maximum depth at the time of indication for magnesium seeding was 28 mm with an intraorbital extension of 7 mm. COURSE OF THERAPY: Magnesium seeding of the haemangioma first lead to a standstill and within 8 weeks to a significant remission. After this period, maximum depth was 6.7 mm without any intraorbital extension. CONCLUSION: Magnesium seeding is a hopeful and low-risked alternative in the therapy of infantile haemangiomas.<p>

The first full-length mRNA for vitellogenin (Vg) from ticks was sequenced. This also represents the first complete sequence of Vg from the Chelicerata and of a heme binding Vg. The Vg cDNA from the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis was 5744nt in length (GenBank Accession number AY885250), which coded for a protein of 1843 aa with a calculated molecular weight of 208 kD. This protein had an 18 aa signal sequence, a single RXXR cleavage signal that would generate two subunits (49.5 and 157K in molecular weight) and lipoprotein N-terminal and carboxy von Willebrand factor type D domains. Tryptic digest MS analysis of vitellin protein confirmed the function of the cDNA as the tick yolk protein. Apparently, vitellin in D. variabilis is oligomeric (possibly dimeric) and is comprised of a mixture of the uncleaved monomer and subunits that were predicted from the single RXXR cleavage signal. The highly conserved GL/ICG motif close to the C-terminus in insect Vg genes was different in the tick Vg message, i.e., GLCS. This variant was also present in a partial sequence of Vg from Boophilus microplus. Phylogenic analysis showed that the full length Vg cDNA from D. variabilis and the partial cDNA from B. microplus were distinct from insects and Crustacea. The Vg message was not found in whole body RNA from unfed or fed males or in unfed and partially fed (virgin) females as determined by Northern blotting. The message was found in replete (mated) pre-ovipositional females, increased to higher levels in ovipositing females and was absent after egg laying was complete. The endocrine regulation of the Vg mRNA is discussed. The tissue sources of the Vg message are both the gut and fat body. Tryptic digest MS fingerprinting suggests that a second Vg mRNA might be present in the American dog tick, which needs further study.<p>

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggesting an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected individuals has heightened the need to understand the relation of HIV infection, antiretroviral therapy use, and non-HIV-related factors with insulin resistance (IR). METHODS: Prospective study of 1614 HIV-infected and 604 HIV-uninfected participants from the Women's Interagency HIV Study between October 2000 and March 2007. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-estimated IR at 11,019 semiannual visits. RESULTS: HIV-infected women reporting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) had higher median HOMA than HIV-uninfected women {1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11 to 1.30] times higher for those reporting protease inhibitor-containing HAART; 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.20) times higher for those reporting non-protease inhibitor-containing HAART}. Among HIV-infected, cumulative exposure to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) of &gt; 3 years was associated with HOMA 1.13 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.25) times higher than the HOMA without any cumulative NRTI exposure. Cumulative exposure to the NRTI stavudine of &gt; 1 year was associated with HOMA 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05 to 1.27) times higher than the HOMA without any cumulative stavudine use. Family history of diabetes, hepatitis C virus seropositivity, higher body mass index, or reporting menopause was associated with higher HOMA. CINCLUSIONS: Longer cumulative exposure to NRTI; in particular, stavudine is associated with greater IR in HIV-infected women.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of a risk of malignancy index (RMI), based on a serum CA125 level, ultrasound findings and menopausal status, to discriminate a benign from a malignant pelvic mass and to discriminate early stage (Figo Stage I) from Stages II, III and IV of ovarian cancer. DESIGN: A prospective study. SETTING: Department of Gynaecology, Trondheim University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seventy-three women, 30 years or older, consecutively admitted between February 1992 and February 1994 for primary laparotomy of a pelvic mass. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of serum CA125 level, ultrasound findings and menopausal status, separately and combined into the RMI, to diagnose ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The RMI was more accurate than any individual criterion in diagnosing cancer. Using a RMI cut-off level of 200 to indicate malignancy, the RMI derived from this dataset gave a sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 92% and positive predictive value of 83%. Applying RMI criteria developed by others, the following test performance was found: sensitivity 71%, specificity 96% and positive predictive value 89%. For the Stages II, III and IV of ovarian cancer the sensitivity increased to approximately 90% without any substantial loss in specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of malignancy index is able to correctly discriminate between malignant and benign pelvic masses. It is a scoring system which can be introduced easily into clinical practice to facilitate the selection of patients for primary surgery at an oncological unit.<p>

Prey of different quality can be distinguished by their effects on fitness parameters (e.g., survival, growth, development) of the predator. This paper describes a series of experiments with wolf spiders, Schizocosa sp., designed to analyze the behavioral and physiological mechanisms by which these effects are brought about. Schizocosa responded to prey of inferior quality by developing an aversion. The number of prey encounters needed for the aversion to develop depended on the prey type and the quality of alternative prey available. As expected, fewer low-quality prey were accepted if prey of higher quality were available; however, acceptance was also reduced if alternative prey were of even lower quality. An aversion disappeared within a few hours to about 1 day. Consumption by Schizocosa of even small amounts of some &quot;toxic&quot; prey species reduced growth by inhibiting feeding rate and impairing utilization of food derived from prey of higher quality. These results have implications for understanding the interactions of generalist predators in community food webs.<p>

Synthesis of influenza virus mRNA is primed by capped and methylated (cap 1, m7GpppXm) RNAs which the virus derives by endonucleolytic cleavage from RNA polymerase II transcripts in host cells. The conserved nature of the endonucleolytic processing provides a unique target for the development of antiviral agents for influenza viruses. A series of 4-substituted 2,4-dioxobutanoic acid compounds has been identified as selective inhibitors of this activity in both influenza A and B viruses. These inhibitors exhibited 50% inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.2 to 29.0 microM for cap-dependent influenza virus transcription and had no effect on the activity of other viral and cellular polymerases when tested at 100- to 500-fold higher concentrations. The compounds did not inhibit the initiation or elongation of influenza virus mRNA synthesis but specifically inhibited the cleavage of capped RNAs by the influenza virus endonuclease and were not inhibitory to the activities of other nucleases. Additionally, the compounds specifically inhibited replication of influenza A and B viruses in cell culture with potencies comparable to the 50% inhibitory concentrations obtained for transcription.<p>

Generally, dietary intake assessment and risk characterization are evaluated using contaminant concentration in raw fish while it is usually ingested cooked, which can cause an overestimation because one of the essential issues for risk-benefit analysis is to determine the maximum amount of a contaminant that can be released from the food matrix and be absorbed by the human body, called bioaccessibility. Moreover, despite most seafood products are cooked before consumption, risk assessment is still evaluated in raw products, strongly affecting public health guidelines. In the present study, an in vitro bioaccessibility assay was performed for Galaxolide (HHCB) in fish samples. Raw spiked hake samples were in vitro digested and aliquots of each fraction of the digestion process were analysed. HHCB was quantitatively present in the bioaccessibility fraction. The effect of fish cooking on HHCB was also evaluated in cod and mackerel samples. Results demonstrate that steaming and grilling processes lead to a loss of 50-70% HHCB in fish.<p>

The occurrence of ten synthetic musks in samples of 10 widely consumed fish and shellfish species from Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) was determined. The most used nitro and polycyclic musks, as well as a well-known transformation product in tissues, were analyzed. Furthermore, the human health risks derived from the musk exposure through seafood consumption were characterized. None of the nitro musks were detected in any of the analyzed samples. In contrast, most of the polycyclic musks were found, being galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) present in all the samples. HHCB was the greatest contributor, with maximum levels in sardine and mackerel (367 and 304 ng g(-1) (d.w.) (dry weight), respectively). The highest exposure to individual musks was estimated for HHCB and HHCB-Lactone, with average values of 19.7 and 6.8 ng kg(-1)bw day(-1), respectively, in adults. A notably lower mean exposure was calculated for AHTN, cashmeran (DPMI) and traseolide (ATII), being ranged between 1.1 and 3.7 ng kg(-1)bw day(-1). The current concentrations of musks in fish and shellfish should not mean human health risks for the adult population living in Tarragona. However, a continuous monitoring would be desirable to assure that the exposure does not follow increasing temporal trends.<p>

Benzothiazoles are high production volume chemicals widely used in many industrial and household applications. However, information on their occurrence in aquatic organisms is very limited, although a high level of bioaccumulation is expected. In this study and for the first time, a method was developed involving subcritical water extraction followed by solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-ion trap-tandem mass spectrometry for the determination of five benzothiazoles in seafood. The repeatability and reproducibility of the method were under 21% (%RSD, n = 5, 100 ng g(-1) (dw)), while method detection limits and method quantification limits were between 0.5 and 10 ng g(-1) (dw) and 1 and 50 ng g(-1) (dw), respectively. Ten widely consumed fish and shellfish species from the county of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) were selected in order to estimate dietary exposure and to assess the human health risks. The most frequently determined compounds were benzothiazole and 2-(methylthio)-benzothiazole, with squid being the species which showed the highest level of benzothiazole (82 ng g(-1) (dw)). In terms of human exposure, the current concentrations of benzothiazoles found in fish and shellfish could not be compared to threshold values because of the lack of toxicological data.<p>

The concentrations of 19 brominated flame retardants (BFRs) (8 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), 8 methoxylated PBDEs (MeO-PBDEs) and 3 emerging flame retardants) were determined in 10 species of fish and shellfish widely consumed in Tarragona County (Catalonia, Spain), by pressurized liquid extraction followed by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. A higher occurrence of PBDEs was found in all the analyzed samples, while MeO-PBDEs were only detected in a few ones and the levels of emerging pollutants were relatively low. In contrast, hexabromobenzene was found in almost all samples at concentrations ranging between non detected and 0.2 ng g(-1) wet weight (w.w.). Salmon, sole, hake, cod and tuna showed the highest concentrations of SigmaPBDEs (&gt;0.8 ng g(-1) w.w.), while mussel was the species with the highest level of MeO-PBDEs (1.5 ng g(-1) w.w.). The dietary exposure of BFRs through consumption of these 10 species of fish and shellfish by the population of Tarragona County was estimated for different subpopulations, classified according to age and gender. Furthermore, calculations were performed in upper-, middle- and lower-bound risk scenarios. According to our data, the current concentrations of BFRs in fish and shellfish suggest no significant health risks for the consumers.<p>

Oocyte development during the first vitellogenic cycle of Coelotes terrestris and Tegenaria domestica is described. Under the present conditions, this development took about 40 days during which the oocytes went through six stages of maturation. For the first time presence of ecdysteroids is reported in adult females of spiders. Hemolymphatic ecdysteroid peaks were observed in both species at the transition between previtellogenesis and vitellogenesis. 20-Hydroxyecdysone and ecdysone were present in slightly different ratios in C. terrestris as well as T. domestica. These data largely agree with current views of ovarian development in Arthropods.<p>

The development of Pardosa saltans wolf spiders inside an egg sac includes two periods: an embryonic period and a post-embryonic period after hatching. We investigated spiderlings' energy expenditure to assess energetic costs during the different embryonic and post-embryonic developmental stages during which they are confined within their egg sac. We focused on the following developmental stages: egg, embryonic stages 1 and 2, and two stages, separated by a moult, during post-embryogenesis inside the egg sac: &quot;juvenile instars 1 and 2&quot; until emergence of 2 instar juveniles from their egg sac. We present the first biochemical characterization of the vitellus of wolf spiders' eggs, embryos and juveniles. Lipovitellins (LV) are composed of four apolipoproteins of 116, 87, 70 and 42 kDa, respectively, and LV represent 35-45% of total protein during development. The principal LV lipids are triglycerides, phospholipids, free fatty acids and sterols. Egg caloric content averaged 127 cal/g (proteins: 91 cal/g, lipids: 33 cal/g, carbohydrates: 3 cal/g). During development from undivided egg to emerged &quot;juvenile 2&quot;, 67% of proteins, 51% of carbohydrates and 49% of triglycerides stocks were depleted. At the end of the post-embryonic period, at emergence from egg sac, body energy stock of &quot;juveniles 2&quot; was 38% of the initial calorie stocks in the eggs.<p>

Travis, F., et al. (2009). &quot;Effects of Transcendental Meditation practice on brain functioning and stress reactivity in college students.&quot; <u>International Journal of Psychophysiology</u> <b>71</b>(2): 170-176.<p>
This randomized controlled trial investigated effects of Transcendental Meditation (TM) practice on Brain Integration Scale scores (broadband frontal coherence, power ratios, and preparatory brain responses), electrodermal habituation to 85-dB tones, sleepiness, heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and P300 latencies in 50 college students. After pretest, students were randomly assigned to learn TM immediately or learn after the 10-week posttest. There were no significant pretest group differences. A MANOVA of students with complete data (N=38) yielded significant group vs treatment interactions for Brain Integration Scale scores, sleepiness, and habituation rates (all p&lt;.007). Post hoc analyses revealed significant increases in Brain Integration Scale scores for Immediate-start students but decreases in Delayed-start students; significant reductions in sleepiness in Immediate-start students with no change in Delayed-start students; and no changes in habituation rates in Immediate-start students, but significant increases in Delayed-start students. These data support the value of TM practice for college students.<p>

BACKGROUND: Norovirus infection is the most frequent cause of infectious diarrhoea in the western world. This study aimed to characterise functionally and histomorphologically the diseased duodenum in human biopsies. METHODS: Norovirus infection was diagnosed by the Kaplan criteria and confirmed by PCR of stool samples. Duodenal biopsies were obtained endoscopically. In miniaturised Ussing chambers, short circuit current, flux measurements and impedance spectroscopy were performed. Histological analysis including apoptosis staining and characterisation of intraepithelial lymphocytes was performed. Tight junction proteins were quantified by immunoblotting. RESULTS: In norovirus infection, epithelial resistance decreased from (mean (SEM)) 24 (2) Omega cm(2) in controls to 10 (1) Omega cm(2). Mannitol flux increased from 113 (24) nmol h(-1) cm(-2) in controls to 242 (29) nmol h(-1) cm(-2). Microdissection revealed a villus surface area reduced by 47% (6.6%). Intraepithelial lymphocytes were increased to 63 (7) per 100 enterocytes, with an increased rate of perforin-positive cytotoxic T cells. Expression of tight junctional proteins occludin, claudin-4 and claudin-5 was reduced. The epithelial apoptotic ratio was doubled in norovirus infection. Furthermore, the basal short circuit current was increased in norovirus infection and could be reduced by bumetanide and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB). CONCLUSIONS: Norovirus infection leads to epithelial barrier dysfunction paralleled by a reduction of sealing tight junctional proteins and an increase in epithelial apoptosis, which may partly be mediated by increased cytotoxic intraepithelial lymphocytes. Furthermore, active anion secretion is markedly stimulated. Thus, the diarrhoea in norovirus infection is driven by both a leak flux and a secretory component.<p>

BACKGROUND: To determine the factors affecting rejection of bariatric candidates at an accredited, American College of Surgeons Level 1A, bariatric program. Bariatric surgery &quot;Centers of Excellence&quot; use a multidisciplinary team to screen patients for eligibility for surgery using insurance, medical history, psychological evaluation findings, and the surgeon assessment. Few studies have reported on the frequency or reasons for patients not being accepted for surgery among high-volume academic bariatric programs. METHODS: From March to September 2007, 299 consecutive patients were accepted for evaluation into an accredited bariatric program and tracked for the incidence of rejection for weight loss surgery. The primary reasons for rejection included a lack of insurance coverage, being medically unfit, psychological or social inappropriateness, and a body mass index (BMI) that did not meet the cutoff (BMI&lt;35 kg/m2 or &lt;40 kg/m2 without co-morbid conditions). RESULTS: Of 299 screened patients, 90 (30.1%) were not accepted for surgery by the multidisciplinary team. The most frequent reason was the lack of insurance coverage (47.8%). Primary care physicians were the most common source of patient referral. All but 1 of the patients excluded because of an inadequate BMI (n=13) had been referred by friends, co-workers, or themselves from information received from the Internet or television. CONCLUSION: Approximately one third of screened patients were not accepted for surgery by an academic bariatric program. Self- or social referral appeared to correlate with rejection because the BMI did not meet the criteria for surgery. This suggests inadequate information among social referral networks and/or in the media. Long-term follow-up will determine the health outcomes of patients not cleared for weight loss surgery.<p>

OBJECTIVE: To develop a predictive index for length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) following cardiac surgery. DESIGN: Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis of a cohort of 1404 patients divided into a derivation set of 713 patients and a validation set of 691 patients. SETTING: St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, a tertiary care cardiovascular centre. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 1990 (derivation set), and Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 1991 (validation set). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A long ICU stay (more than 2 days). Other outcomes analysed were ICU stays over 4, 7 and 10 days, and death. RESULTS: In the derivation set increasing age, female sex, left ventricular function, type of surgery, and urgency of surgery were found to be independent risk factors for a long ICU stay in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A predictive index was created by assigning risk scores based on the odds ratios of the significant variables in the logistic regression analysis. The predictive index was found to predict lengths of ICU stay greater than 2, 4, 7 and 10 days, and patient death in the validation set. CONCLUSIONS: Length of ICU stay and death following cardiac surgery can be predicted with a multivariate predictive index. The index has potential application as a means of stratifying cardiac surgical risk as well as in optimizing ICU resource planning when resources are limited.<p>

Several small, achiral nonpeptide inhibitors of HIV-1 protease with low micromolar activity were identified by mass screening of the Parke-Davis compound library. Two of the compounds, structurally similar, were both found to be competitive and reversible inhibitors [compound 1, 4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxypropyl)-1-benzopyran-2-one: Ki = 1.0 microM; compound 2, 4-hydroxy-6-phenyl-3-(phenylthio)-pyran-2-one: Ki = 1.1 microM]. These inhibitors were chosen as initial leads for optimization of in vitro inhibitory activity based on molecular modeling and X-ray crystallographic structural data. While improvements in inhibitory potency were small with analogues of compound 1, important X-ray crystallographic structural information of the enzyme-inhibitor complex was gained. When bound, 1 was found to displace H2O301 in the active site while hydrogen bonding to the catalytic Asps and Ile50 and Ile150. The pyranone group of compound 2 was found to bind at the active site in the same manner, with the 6-phenyl and the 3-phenylthio occupying P1 and P1', respectively. The structural information was used to develop design strategies to reach three or four of the internal pockets, P2-P2'. This work led to analogues of diverse structure with high potency (IC50 &lt; 10 nM) that contain either one or no chiral centers and remain nonpeptide. The highly potent compounds possess less anti-HIV activity in cellular assays than expected, and current optimization now focuses on increasing cellular activity. The value of the HIV-1 protease inhibitors described is their potential as better pharmacological agents with a different pattern of viral resistance development, relative to the peptide inhibitors in human clinical trials.<p>

The human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) oncoprotein Tax is a potent activator of viral and cellular gene transcription. Tax does not bind DNA directly but utilizes cellular transcription factors to mediate activation. In this report, we examine the role of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins in Tax deregulation of gene expression, as these proteins play a critical role in progression through the cell cycle and have been implicated in neoplastic disease. We show that the bHLH proteins do not mediate activation, but instead mediate repression of gene expression in the presence of Tax. We further show that a consensus bHLH binding site in the promoter of the beta-polymerase gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in DNA repair, mediates the previously reported repression of beta-polymerase gene expression by Tax. Together, these results suggest that Tax may induce malignant transformation, at least in part, through bHLH-mediated repression of key cellular regulatory genes.<p>

Previous studies have documented that the barrier function of epithelial or endothelial monolayers is deranged when cellular ATP levels are rapidly decreased to very low levels by inhibitors of mitochondrial and glycolytic function. We hypothesized that lesser degrees of ATP depletion also might affect epithelial permeability, particularly if the perturbation were sustained for a prolonged interval. Using Caco-2BBe cells grown on permeable supports mounted in bicameral chambers, we assessed permeability by measuring the apical-to-basolateral clearance (flux divided by apical compartment concentration) of fluorescein disulfonic acid. ATP was depleted by incubating cells in glucose-free (Glu-) medium containing 10 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) for 12, 24, or 48 h or under an anoxic atmosphere for 24, 48, or 72 h. Although both models of energy depletion were characterized by significant derangements in barrier function, metabolic inhibition with 2-DOG/ Glu- resulted in greater increases in permeability and more profound decrements in cellular ATP content. Morphological studies using electron and confocal fluorescence microscopy showed structural changes in individual cells and derangements in the normal distribution of perijunctional actin after monolayers were incubated with 2-DOG/Glu- but not after incubation under an anoxic atmosphere. Addition of 10 mM lactic acid (final pH 6.7) provided significant protection against both hyperpermeability and ATP depletion induced by 2-DOG/Glu-. We conclude that moderate degrees of ATP depletion are sufficient to increase the permeability of Caco-2BBe monolayers and that lactic acidosis helps to preserve ATP content, barrier function, and morphological integrity in hypoxic intestinal epithelial cells.<p>

Urvillea chacoensis is a climber with 2n = 22 and some terminal AT-rich heterochromatin blocks that differentiate it from other species of the genus. The AT-rich highly repeated satellite DNA was isolated from U. chacoensis by the digestion of total nuclear DNA with HindIII and XbaI and cloned in Escherichia coli. Satellite DNA structure and chromosomal distribution were investigated. DNA sequencing revealed that the repeat length of satDNA ranges between 721 and 728 bp, the percentage of AT-base pairs was about 72-73% and the studied clones showed an identity of 92.5-95.9%. Although this monomer has a tetranucleosomal size, direct imperfect repetitions of ~180 bp subdividing it in four nucleosomal subregions were observed. The results obtained with FISH indicate that this monomer usually appears distributed in the terminal regions of most chromosomes and is associated to heterochromatin blocks observed after DAPI staining. These observations are discussed in relation to the satellite DNA evolution and compared with other features observed in several plant groups.<p>

The fatty acid compositions of phospholipids and triacylglycerols from selected orthognath spider tissues, scorpion body segments, whole millipedes, and whole labidognath spiders were determined. The major components were C16 and C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids as well as C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids. The eicosanoid precursor polyunsaturated fatty acids 20:4n-6 and 20:5n-3 were present in substantial proportions of phospholipids in all tissues examined. The fatty acid profiles of these terrestrial arthropods differ markedly from corresponding profiles of terrestrial insects in that substantially greater proportions of C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids are present in the organisms in this study. This finding supports the idea that maintaining low proportions of C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids is a special condition of terrestrial insects.<p>

CONTEXT: Hospital accreditors are placing increased emphasis on the timeliness with which critical laboratory results are reported to caregivers. OBJECTIVE: To measure the speed of critical result notification at a group of laboratories, identify factors associated with faster reporting, and place findings in the context of the time required to transport and test specimens and to correct critical abnormalities. DESIGN: Contemporaneous review of 3545 inpatient and emergency department critical result notifications in 121 laboratories enrolled in the College of American Pathologists Q-Probes program. RESULTS: The median laboratory required a median of 5 minutes for staff to notify someone about a critical result once testing was complete. Laboratories affiliated with smaller institutions (P = .01), rural laboratories (P = .001), and sites that called results before releasing them from the laboratory computer (P = .02) were able to notify caregivers more quickly. There was variation among institutions in the time it took to notify caregivers (interquartile range, 1.5-8 minutes). At the median facility, notification took place 56.5 minutes after the specimen had been collected. CONCLUSIONS: The time required to notify caregivers of a critical laboratory result is a small proportion of the time taken to collect and test specimens or the time that has been reported for caregivers to correct abnormalities. Although failure to notify caregivers of critical results may represent an important patient safety vulnerability, the timeliness of laboratory notification is a minor contributor to total test turnaround time at most institutions.<p>

It is well known that scorpions are highly adapted to thermal temperatures. However, little is known of the metabolic and respiration adaptations caused by temperature fluctuations in these animals. Therefore we used the African burrowing scorpion Opistophthalmus latimanus to measure the effect of temperature on its metabolism and respiration. Radioactive d-glucose was injected into the ventral sinus of the circulatory system and metabolites of d-glucose were determined after six hour incubation at four temperatures (7, 17, 25 and 37 degrees C). The oxygen consumption rate (MO2) and carbon dioxide production rate (MCO2) were measured simultaneously at 17, 25 and 37 degrees C. The metabolomics investigation included LC-MS, GC-MS and NMR analytical platforms. The average radioactivity recovered after the carbon-14 d-glucose injection, glycogen precipitation and column fractionation at the four temperatures was between 92.4% and 95.0%. Strong acids, CO2 and neutral compounds all increased with temperature, while glycogen and neutral sugars decreased as the temperature increased. Weak acids initially increased with temperature, then decreased again as the temperature was increased to 37 degrees C. Respiration also gradually increased as the temperature was increased. Metabolomics identified 23 metabolites that were significantly influenced by temperature. Pathway analysis of these metabolites indicated numerous metabolic pathways that were affected by temperature, clearly demonstrating that the scorpion uses proteins, lipids and carbohydrates at higher temperatures to generate energy. However, protein catabolism seems to be the main source of energy at higher temperatures in these animals, although this needs to be confirmed in a more targeted metabolomics study.<p>

Somatostatin receptor (SS-R) scintigraphy has been successfully used in the visualization of a variety of neuroendocrine tumours. In vitro studies have shown that SS-Rs are present in human malignant lymphomas. We conducted a prospective study in 56 consecutive untreated patients with histologically proven Hodgkin's disease (HD) and compared the results of SS-R scintigraphy with physical and radiological examinations as initial evaluation. SS-R scintigraphy was positive in 55/56 (98%) patients at sites of documented disease. In 20 patients SS-R scintigraphy disclosed lymphoma localizations not revealed following procedures of conventional staging. As a result in 12 patients (21%) SS-R scintigraphy produced a change of stage and in seven patients (13%) the additional information obtained from SS-R scintigraphy led to a change of treatment. SS-R scintigraphy failed to visualize sites of HD in four patients, mainly in the abdominal area. In three patients a false-positive result was obtained. These data show that SS-R scintigraphy provides an imaging technique that appears to visualize tumours in most patients with HD and may be clinically useful in the management of these patients.<p>

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor mediating the adverse effects of dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, we investigated the genetic-, time-, dose-, species- and tissue-dependent AhR-mediated agonistic/antagonistic activities of three food flavonoids: quercetin, chrysin and genistein. To that end, four stably transfected cell lines were used in cell-based luciferase reporter gene assays: three lines were transformed with the ptKLuc vector harbouring four dioxin-responsive elements (DREs) upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter and the luciferase gene (HepG2-Luc, T-47D-Luc and H4IIE-ULg). The fourth is a patented cell line transformed with a different construct: H4IIE DR-CALUX((R)). Both H4IIE cells were compared for their genetic construction. Human hepatoma (HepG2-Luc) and human breast tumour (T-47D-Luc) cells were compared for tissue-dependent effects. Rat hepatoma (H4IIE-ULg) and human hepatoma (HepG2-Luc) cells were compared for species-dependent activities. We concluded that quercetin, chrysin and genistein act in a time-, dose-, species- and tissue-specific way. For example, genistein displayed agonistic activities when exposed to rat hepatoma cells during 6h but not after 24h. Flavonoids displayed agonistic/antagonistic activities in human breast tumour cells, depending on the exposure time, while in human hepatoma cells, only antagonistic activities of flavonoids were measured. In addition, we report, in all the cells, a synergy between an isoflavone and two food contaminants; the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and 3-methylcholanthrene, a PAH. In rat cells, this synergy occurred when cells were exposed to flavonoids and contaminant for 6h, while it was observed in human cells only after 24h.<p>

Three groups that absorb in the 2100-1800-cm-1 infrared spectral region have recently been detected in Ni-hydrogenase from Chromatium vinosum [Bagley, K.A., Duin, E.C., Roseboom, W., Albracht, S. P.J. &amp; Woodruff, W.H. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 5527-5535]. To assess the significance and generality of this observation, we have carried out an infrared-spectroscopic study of eight hydrogenases of three different types (nickel, iron and metal-free) and of 11 other iron-sulfur and/or nickel proteins. Infrared bands in the 2100-1800-cm-1 spectral region were found in spectra of all Ni-hydrogenases and Fe-hydrogenases and were absent from spectra of any of the other proteins, including a metal-free hydrogenase. The positions of these bands are dependent on the redox state of the hydrogenase. The three groups in Ni-hydrogenases that are detected by infrared spectroscopy are assigned to the three unidentified small non-protein ligands that coordinate iron in the dinuclear Ni/Fe active site as observed in the X-ray structure of the enzyme from Desulfovibrio gigas [Volbeda, A., Charon, M.-H., Piras, C., Hatchikian, E.C., Frey, M. &amp; Fontecilla-Camps, J.C. (1995) Nature 373, 580-587]. It is concluded that these groups occur exclusively in metal-containing H2-activating enzymes. It is proposed that the active sites of Ni-hydrogenases and of Fe-hydrogenases have a similar architecture, that is required for the activation of molecular hydrogen.<p>

For calculation of fractional flow reserve (FFR), simultaneous registration of both aortic pressure (Pa) and transstenotic distal coronary pressure (Pd) is necessary at steady-state maximum coronary hyperemia. The aim of the present study was to compare the maximum transstenotic gradient (delta Pmax) and pressure-derived myocardial fractional flow reserve (FFRmyo), observed during intravenous adenosine infusion, to delta Pmax and FFRmyo induced by intracoronary papaverine, which is considered to be the gold standard for induction of coronary hyperemia, but acts too short for steady-state hyperemic pressure recordings and is associated with QT-prolongation. In 24 patients with coronary stenoses of various degrees, Pa and Pd were measured simultaneously by the diagnostic catheter and a high fidelity 0.018&quot; fiberoptic pressure monitoring guide wire, respectively. Excellent steady-state phasic intracoronary pressure recordings were obtained in all patients within 1 min after start of intravenous adenosine infusion at a rate of 140 micrograms/kg/min, and compared to delta Pmax obtained 30 sec after intracoronary administration of papaverine (12 mg LCA, 10 mg RCA). Delta Pmax was 24 +/- 15 mmHg during adenosine infusion and 24 +/- 15 mmHg after papaverine administration. Myocardial fractional flow reserve, calculated from these pressure recordings, was 0.75 +/- 0.16 and 0.75 +/- 0.15, respectively, with an individual difference of 0.02 +/- 0.01 between both values (r = 0.99). No important side effects by intravenous infusion of adenosine were observed. Thus intravenous adenosine infusion at a rate of 140 micrograms/kg/min is an excellent and safe alternative for induction of steady-state maximum coronary hyperemia and therefore is an ideal vasodilator for determination of fractional flow reserve based upon pressure recordings.<p>

Specific somatostatin receptors (ssts) have been described in normal and tumor tissues and identified on more than 95% of normal mitogen-activated human peripheral lymphocytes. Somatostatin may modulate the immune response by a variety of mechanisms, most of which are inhibitory, sst scintigraphy in patients with immune-mediated diseases revealed sst expression in 97% of patients with sarcoidosis, 100% of patients with tuberculosis or Wegener's granulomatosis, 75% of patients with Sjogren's syndrome, and 50% of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus or uveitis. sst expression appeared to be related to progression or remission of disease. Patients who responded poorly to therapy remained positive at scintigraphy. Investigation of 10 human B-cell lines and eight human T-cell lines, using a polymerase chain reaction, revealed the presence of sst2-mRNA in two of the B-cell and two of the T-cell lines. Visualization of ssts on activated mononuclear leukocytes by sst scintigraphy may prove useful in evaluating the spread of immune-mediated diseases and their responses to therapy. The efficacy of octreotide should be studied in patients with these diseases.<p>

Substance P, an 11-amino acid neuropeptide, has an important role in modulating pain transmission through neurokinin 1 and 2 receptors. Substance P and other tachykinins may also play a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. In this study we present the results concerning the metabolism of the substance P analogue [111In-DTPA-Arg1]-substance P in man, as well as the visualization of the thymus in patients with immune-mediated diseases. Twelve selected patients were investigated, comprising five with inflammatory bowel disease, one with ophthalmic Graves' disease, one with sclerosing cholangitis, one with Sjogren's syndrome, one with rheumatoid arthritis, one with systemic lupus erythematosus and two with myasthenia gravis. During and after intravenous administration of 150-250 MBq (2.5-5.0 microg) [111In-DTPA-Arg1]-substance P, blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were monitored. Radioactivity was measured in blood, urine and faeces during the 48 h after injection. Planar and single-photon emission tomographic images were obtained 4 and 24 h after injection. After administration of [111In-DTPA-Arg1]-substance P, a transient flush was observed in all patients. Degradation of [111In-DTPA-Arg1]-substance P started in the first minutes after administration, resulting in a half-life of 10 min for the total plasma radioactivity, and of 4 min for the intact radiopharmaceutical, as identified with high-performance liquid chromatography. Urinary excretion accounted for &gt;95% of the radioactivity within 24 h post injection, and up to 0.05% was found in the faeces up to 60 h. In all patients uptake of radioactivity was found in the areolae mammae (in women), liver, spleen, kidneys and urinary bladder. In eight patients a high uptake of [111In-DTPA-Arg1]-substance P was observed in the thymus. We conclude that, despite its short half-life, [111In-DTPA-Arg1]-substance P, a new radiopharmaceutical, can be used to visualize the thymus. This may contribute to the investigation of the role of thymus in immune-mediated diseases. In addition, inflammatory sites in various diseases could be visualized.<p>

Fumarase from the syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacterium strain MPOB was purified 130-fold under anoxic conditions. The native enzyme had an apparent molecular mass of 114 kDa and was composed of two subunits of 60 kDa. The enzyme exhibited maximum activity at pH 8.5 and approximately 54 degrees C. The Km values for fumarate and L-malate were 0.25 mM and 2.38 mM, respectively. Fumarase was inactivated by oxygen, but the activity could be restored by addition of Fe2+ and &amp;beta;-mercaptoethanol under anoxic conditions. EPR spectroscopy of the purified enzyme revealed the presence of a [3Fe-4S] cluster. Under reducing conditions, only a trace amount of a [4Fe-4S] cluster was detected. Addition of fumarate resulted in a significant increase of this [4Fe-4S] signal. The N-terminal amino acid sequence showed similarity to the sequences of fumarase A and B of Escherichia coli (56%) and fumarase A of Salmonella typhimurium (63%).<p>

Throughout the biological world, a 30 A hydrophobic film typically delimits the environments that serve as the margin between life and death for individual cells. Biochemical and biophysical findings have provided a detailed model of the composition and structure of membranes, which includes levels of dynamic organization both across the lipid bilayer (lipid asymmetry) and in the lateral dimension (lipid domains) of membranes. How do cells apply anabolic and catabolic enzymes, translocases and transporters, plus the intrinsic physical phase behaviour of lipids and their interactions with membrane proteins, to create the unique compositions and multiple functionalities of their individual membranes?<p>

BACKGROUND: The comparative effects of omeprazole and lansoprazole on gastric acidity in Helicobacter pylori-positive subjects and the clearance of H. pylori are unknown. METHODS: Eighteen asymptomatic H. pylori-positive subjects were studied. Each volunteer received 7 days of omeprazole, lansoprazole, or placebo in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study, with a washout period of 4-6 weeks between treatments. At the end of each treatment period 24-h dual-point intragastric pH-metry was performed, and H. pylori clearance was assessed. RESULTS: Both omeprazole (corpus/antrum pH: 5.5/5.5) and lansoprazole (5.4/5.4) increased intragastric pH compared with placebo (1.5/1.3). Over the 24-h recording there was no difference between the two treatments with regard to control of intragastric pH or clearance of H. pylori. CONCLUSION: Omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, and lansoprazole, 30 mg once daily, are comparably effective antisecretory agents in H. pylori-positive subjects. Both agents provide only transient clearance of H. pylori in a few subjects.<p>

Glucosinolates are plant metabolites containing an anionic nitrogeneous thioglucosidic core structure and a structurally diverse amino acid-derived side chain, which after hydrolysis by thioglucohydrolases (myrosinases) afford biological active degradation products such as nitriles and isothiocyanates. Structural diversity in glucosinolates is partially due to enzymatic modifications occurring on the preformed core structure, like the recently described oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides catalyzed by a flavin monooxygenase identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. The enzyme product, 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate, bears a chiral sulfoxide group in its side chain. We have analyzed the epimeric purity of 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate by NMR methods using a chiral lanthanide shift reagent. The absolute configuration of the sulfoxide group has been established by comparing the 1H NMR spectra of the two sulfoximine diastereomers of natural 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate. According to our data, 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate isolated from broccoli and A. thaliana is a pure epimer and its sulfoxide group has the RS configuration. The product of the A. thaliana flavin monooxygenase has these same properties demonstrating that the enzyme is stereospecific and supporting its involvement in glucosinolate side chain formation.<p>

Spiders have been incriminated as causes of human suffering for centuries, but few species worldwide cause medically significant envenomation. Widow spiders (Latrodectus spp.) occur worldwide and cause latrodectism, which is characterized by pain (local and generalized) associated with nonspecific systemic effects, diaphoresis, and less commonly other autonomic and neurological effects. Recluse spiders (Loxosceles spp.) are distributed mostly through the tropical and subtropical Western Hemisphere and can cause severe skin lesions and rarely systemic effects; most bites are unremarkable. Highly dangerous spiders in South America (armed spiders) and Australia (funnel-web spiders) cause rare but severe envenomation requiring medical intervention and sometimes antivenom. Most other spiders involved in verified bites cause minor, transient effects. Many spiders blamed for causing medical mischief have been elevated to medical significance via circumstantial evidence, poor reporting, and repetitive citation in the literature; several species have been shown to be harmless with more stringent scientific evidence involving verified bites in humans.<p>

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that a &quot;working conference&quot; (WC; tumor board format in which any case requiring multispecialty input is presented for discussion) was preferable to a &quot;fascinating case&quot; (FC; only &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;unusual&quot; cases presented) format, tumor board format at the Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center was changed from FC to WC. RESULTS: The number of cases presented in tumor board reflected this change. For example, for the period from 1990 to 1991 (prior to the change), 63 of 557 registered cases (11%) were presented in tumor board. By 1992-1993, 206 of 547 registered cases (38%) were presented. This increase was highly significant (p &lt; 0.001). Three years after the format change, the authors surveyed 22 regular participants of the tumor board, many of whom had been participants prior to the change. Of those surveyed, 77% preferred the WC to the FC format, and 18% preferred a combined format. Most of those surveyed felt that the WC format was more helpful to the provider and to patient care (86% and 100%, respectively). Eighty percent felt that the WC format facilitated protocol enrollment, and 100% of the respondents were satisfied with the quality of case discussion that resulted from the WC format. CONCLUSIONS: The change to a &quot;working case&quot; format increased provider satisfaction with tumor board quality compared with the previous &quot;fascinating case&quot; format.<p>

The nature of genetic variation for Drosophila longevity in a population of recombinant inbred lines was investigated by estimating quantitative genetic parameters and mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adult life span in five environments: standard culture conditions, high and low temperature, and heat-shock and starvation stress. There was highly significant genetic variation for life span within each sex and environment. In the analysis of variance of life span pooled over sexes and environments, however, the significant genetic variation appeared in the genotype x sex and genotype x environment interaction terms. The genetic correlation of longevity across the sexes and environments was not significantly different from zero in these lines. We estimated map positions and effects of QTL affecting life span by linkage to highly polymorphic roo transposable element markers, using a multiple-trait composite interval mapping procedure. A minimum of 17 QTL were detected; all were sex and/or environment-specific. Ten of the QTL had sexually antagonistic or antagonistic pleiotropic effects in different environments. These data provide support for the pleiotropy theory of senescence and the hypothesis that variation for longevity might be maintained by opposing selection pressures in males and females and variable environments. Further work is necessary to assess the generality of these results, using different strains, to determine heterozygous effects and to map the life span QTL to the level of genetic loci.<p>

We have previously identified a new gene with sequence homology to the WASP-family of actin regulators denoted WAFL (WASP and FKBP-like). Here we report a possible biological function for WAFL, by demonstrating an association to early endosomes via its central coiled-coil domain. Further we show by functional and structural studies that WAFL is associated with both microtubules and the actin filament system, the two means of transport of early endosomes. In addition, WAFL interacts with WASP-interacting protein (WIP) and actin, thus linking WAFL to actin dynamics. The use of RNAi depletion of WAFL shows that WAFL-deficient cells display delayed transport of endosomal cargo. Our findings are compatible with a model whereby WAFL is involved in the transport of early endosomes at the level of transition between microfilament-based and microtubule-based movement.<p>

Viral variants with different biological properties predominate in the central nervous system (CNS) and lymphoid tissues of carrier mice infected at birth with the Armstrong strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. The CNS isolates have the same phenotype as the parental strain and cause acute infections in adult mice, while the spleen-derived isolates cause chronic infections associated with suppressed T-cell responses and susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Our previous studies have identified a single amino acid change in the viral glycoprotein, a phenylalanine-to-leucine (F--&gt;L) mutation at residue 260, that correlates with the tissue-specific selection and the persistent and immunosuppressive phenotype of the spleen isolates (R. Ahmed, C.S. Hahn, T. Somasundaram, L. Villarete, M. Matloubian, and J. H. Strauss, J. Virol. 65:4242-4247, 1991). In this study, we screened viral isolates obtained from the spleen, liver, kidney, and brain of carrier mice for the presence of this mutation and determined the temporal selection of variants as they appear in these organs. We found that this F--&gt;L amino acid change is common to &gt; 90% of the spleen and liver isolates and is selected for rapidly by day 32 postinfection (p.i.). Although the kinetics observed in the kidney are relatively slower than in the spleen and liver, this F--&gt;L mutation predominates in the kidney-derived isolates by 250 days p.i. In contrast, the majority of the CNS isolates retain the parental sequence up to 250 days p.i. In addition, most of the brain isolates replicated efficiently in a neuronal cell line, and this enhanced growth phenotype in neurons correlated with the parental F genotype. This linkage with neurotropism, along with our earlier finding that the F--&gt;L mutation is necessary for enhanced infection of macrophages (M. Matloubian, S. R. Kolhekar, T. Somasundaram, and R. Ahmed, J. Virol. 67:7340-7349, 1993), provides a cellular basis for the molecular changes associated with tissue-specific selection. Taken together, these results suggest that tropism for macrophages is a critical determinant in selection of variants with the F--&gt;L mutation in tissues such as spleen and liver, and tropism for neurons is important in retention of the F genotype in the CNS.<p>

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that diffuse non-metastatic enlargement of the adrenal glands occurs in patients with malignant disease. Measurements of the adrenal glands were obtained from computed tomographic (CT) images in two groups of patients with malignant disease (47 patients with lymphoma and 144 patients with other primary tumours) and a control group consisting of 55 patients without malignant disease. Patients with conditions known to affect the adrenal glands were excluded. Adrenal glands with focal mass lesions, as judged by CT, were also excluded. The following measurements were obtained: the maximum width perpendicular to the long axis of the gland; and maximum width of the medial and lateral limbs. There was a statistically significant difference in all measurements between the control group and the groups with lymphoma and other tumours. No significant difference was demonstrated in the size of the adrenal glands in patients with different stages of malignancy. We have shown that the adrenal glands are enlarged in patients with malignant tumours, including lymphoma. We believe that this enlargement is due to adrenal hyperplasia rather than to metastatic neoplasm.<p>

The aim of our study was to determine the size of normal adrenal glands. Measurements of the adrenal glands were obtained from computed tomographic (CT) images in 55 patients already undergoing CT for routine clinical indications. Patients with conditions known to affect the size of adrenal glands or cases with focal adrenal enlargement suggesting a mass were excluded. The following dimensions were measured: the maximum width perpendicular to the long axis of the body of the gland, and maximum width of the medial and lateral limbs. The average measurements for the right adrenal gland were: maximum width 0.61 cm (S.D. 0.2), width of the medial limb 0.28 cm (S.D. 0.08), and width of the lateral limb 0.28 cm (S.D. 0.06). The average measurements for the left adrenal gland were: maximum width 0.79 cm (S.D. 0.21), width of the medial limb 0.33 cm (S.D. 0.09), and width of the lateral limb 0.30 cm (S.D. 0.10) [corrected].<p>

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the age distribution of primiparous women and its influence on pregnancy and birth risks, presentation at birth and mode of delivery. STUDY DESIGN: We analysed the perinatal statistics of eight German federal states for the years 1998-2000. For our analysis we defined maternal age groups as follows: &lt; 22, 22-32, &gt; 32 years. RESULTS: We identified a total of 508,926 singleton pregnancies. 247,593 of these were delivered by primiparous women without preceding live or stillbirths. The mean age of the primiparas was 26.9 years. For older primiparas &gt; 32 years the proportion with previous miscarriages and terminations of pregnancy was &gt; 20 %. The risk of premature rupture of membranes, abnormal CTG and prolonged labour increased clearly with age. 91.0 % of women &lt; 22 years and 84.5 % of women &gt; 32 years had a normal cephalic presentation. Regarding the mode of delivery, 77.1 % (&lt; 22 years) and 53.1 % (&gt; 32 years) experienced spontaneous delivery, 14.5 % (&lt; 22 years) and 32.3 % (&gt; 32 years) had a Caesarean section. CONCLUSIONS: Older primiparas have a higher proportion of previous miscarriages and terminations of pregnancy. They more commonly experience pathological presentations and also more frequently require Caesarean section. This means that a delayed first pregnancy - an increasingly common phenomenon in Germany - goes along with an increased likelihood of birth risks, Caesarean sections and peripartal interventions. Older primiparous women constitute a special risk group which may require a more intense level of care.<p>

Voigt, M., et al. (2008). &quot;Obesity and pregnancy--a risk profile.&quot; <u>Zeitschrift für Geburtshilfe und Neonatologie</u> <b>212</b>(6): 201-205.<p>
AIM: We aimed to illustrate the relationship between maternal obesity during pregnancy and maternal and fetal outcomes. We examined the influence of maternal BMI at the beginning of pregnancy on risks of pregnancy and birth, and on the somatic classification of the neonates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our retrospective cohort study we included 499,267 singleton pregnancies taken from the German perinatal statistics of 1998-2000. 51,506 obese pregnant women (BMI &gt;or= 30) were compared to 320,148 pregnant women of normal weight (BMI 18.50-24.99). We divided obesity into 3 BMI-categories: BMI = 30.00-34.99, BMI = 35.00-39.99, and BMI &gt;or= 40.00. We defined small-for-gestational-age (SGA), appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA), and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) status by birth weight percentiles. RESULTS: 10.3 % of all pregnant women had a BMI &gt;or= 30.00 and 0.8 % had a BMI &gt;or= 40.00. The frequency of hypertension increased with the extent of obesity: 7.1 % (BMI = 30.00-34.99), 12.5 % (BMI = 35.00-39.99) and 18.3 % (BMI &gt;or= 40.00) compared to 1.2 % (BMI 18.50-24.99). Cephalopelvic disproportion was found in 6.8 % (BMI &gt;or= 40.00) compared to 2.8 % (BMI 18.50-24.99). Fetal macrosomia occurred in 24.8 % (BMI &gt;or= 40.00) compared to 7.9 % in the control group. Rates of pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and fetal structural anomalies also increased with maternal BMI. Women with different BMIs differed in parity but not in age. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity during pregnancy is associated with a range of maternal and fetal adverse outcomes. Pregnancy in obese women therefore calls for close monitoring and careful planning of delivery. Pre-conceptional weight reduction should be considered.<p>

Hemocyanins are large oligomeric respiratory proteins found in many arthropods and molluscs. The hemocyanin of the tarantula Eurypelma californicum is a 24-mer protein complex with molecular mass of 1, 726,459 Da that consists of seven different polypeptides (a-g), each occupying a distinct position within the native molecule. Here we report the complete molecular structure of the E. californicum hemocyanin as deduced from the corresponding cDNAs. This represents the first complex arthropod hemocyanin to be completely sequenced. The different subunits display 52-66% amino acid sequence identity. Within the subunits, the central domain, which bears the active center with the copper-binding sites A and B, displays the highest degree of identity. Using a homology modeling approach, the putative three-dimensional structure of individual subunits was deduced and compared. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that differentiation of the individual subunits occurred 400-550 million years ago. The hemocyanin of the stemline Chelicerata was probably a hexamer built up of six distinct subunit types a, b/c, d, e, f, and g, whereas that of the early Arachnida was originally a 24-mer that emerged after the differentiation of subunits b and c.<p>

Although many articles have reported immune abnormalities in autism, NK cell activity has only been examined in one study of 31 patients, of whom 12 were found to have reduced NK activity. The mechanism behind this low NK cell activity was not explored. For this reason, we explored the measurement of NK cell activity in 1027 blood samples from autistic children obtained from ten clinics and compared the results to 113 healthy controls. This counting of NK cells and the measurement of their lytic activity enabled us to express the NK cell activity/100 cells. At the cutoff of 15-50 LU we found that NK cell activity was low in 41-81% of the patients from the different clinics. This NK cell activity below 15 LU was found in only 8% of healthy subjects (p&lt;0.001). Low NK cell activity in both groups did not correlate with percentage and absolute number of CD16(+)/CD56(+) cells. When the NK cytotoxic activity was expressed based on activity/100 CD16(+)/CD56(+) cells, several patients who had displayed NK cell activity below 15 LU exhibited normal NK cell activity. Overall, after this correction factor, 45% of the children with autism still exhibited low NK cell activity, correlating with the intracellular level of glutathione. Finally, we cultured lymphocytes of patients with low or high NK cell activity/cell with or without glutathione, IL-2 and IL-15. The induction of NK cell activity by IL-2, IL-15 and glutathione was more pronounced in a subgroup with very low NK cell activity. We conclude that that 45% of a subgroup of children with autism suffers from low NK cell activity, and that low intracellular levels of glutathione, IL-2 and IL-15 may be responsible.<p>

Human graviceptors, located in the trunk by Mittelstaedt, probably transduce acceleration by abdominal viscera motion. As demonstrated previously in biodynamic vibration and impact tolerance research, the thoraco-abdominal viscera exhibit a resonance at 4 to 6 Hz. Behavioral observations and mechanical models of otolith graviceptor response indicate a phase shift, increasing with frequency between 0.01 and 0.5 Hz. Consequently, the potential exists for intermodality sensory conflict between vestibular and visceral graviceptor signals, at least at the mechanical receptor level. The frequency range of this potential conflict corresponds with the primary frequency range for motion sickness incidence in transportation, in subjects rotated about Earth-horizontal axes (barbecue spit stimulation), and in periodic parabolic flight microgravity research, and also for erroneous perception of vertical oscillations in helicopters. We discuss the implications of this hypothesis for previous self-motion perception research and suggestions for various future studies.<p>

OBJECTIVES: To compare the effects of oral suspensions of megestrol acetate, 800 mg/d, and placebo on body weight in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related weight loss. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Outpatient community and university patient care setting. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with AIDS who had substantial weight loss and anorexia were enrolled. Of 271 patients, 270 and 195 were evaluable for safety and efficacy, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or megestrol acetate (100 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg) daily for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary efficacy criterion was weight gain. Patients were evaluated at 4-week intervals for changes in weight and body composition, caloric intake, sense of well-being, toxic effects, and appetite. RESULTS: For evaluable patients receiving 800 mg of megestrol acetate per day, 64.2% gained 2.27 kg (5 pounds) or more compared with 21.4% of patients receiving placebo (P &lt; 0.001). An intent-to-treat analysis showed significant differences (P = 0.002) between those receiving placebo and those receiving 800 mg of megestrol acetate for the number of patients who gained 2.27 kg (5 pounds) or more (8 of 32 [25%] compared with 38 of 61 [62.3%], respectively). Compared with patients receiving placebo at the time of maximum weight change, evaluable patients receiving megestrol acetate, 800 mg/d, reported improvement in overall well-being and had an increase in mean weight gain (-0.725 compared with 3.54 kg [-1.6 compared with +7.8 pounds]; P &lt; 0.001), lean body mass (-0.772 compared with +1.14 kg [-1.7 compared with +2.5 pounds]; P &lt; 0.001), appetite grade (P &lt; 0.001), and caloric intake (-107 compared with +645.6 calories/d; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AIDS-related weight loss, megestrol acetate can stimulate appetite, food intake, and statistically significant weight gain that is associated with a patient-reported improvement in an overall sense of well-being.<p>

The objective of this study was to determine the stability of metronidazole benzoate suspension in SyrSpend SF One-Step Suspension system. The studied samples were packaged in 60-mL amber plastic prescription bottles, which were stored protected from light under controlled environmental conditions for a period of 360 days. Stability of metronidazole benzoate suspension in SyrSpend SF was assessed based on retention of initial color or appearance, pH of suspension, and recovery of metronidazole benzoate from the packaged product. Duplicate samples were evaluated at each predefined time interval. An assay method by high performance liquid chromatography was validated for its specificity and stability-indicating characteristscs through a forced-degradation study, and was used in metronidazole benzoate assay. Metronidazole benzoate in SyrSpend SF retained its normal appearance of an opaque suspension, with acceptable pH values ranging from 4.43 to 4.53 (range 4.45 +/- 0.5). Recovery of metronidazole benzoate at subsequent time points was within 90% to 110% of inital concentration for samples stored at refrigerated temperature (2 deg C to 8 deg C), and ambient condition (25 deg C/60% relative humidity), with no detectable changes in chromatographic profile for most tested samples. The rates of change in potency for metronidazole benzoate were determined under the assumptions of first-order kinetics, and the time to reach 90% to 110% initial concentration was determined to be 366 days for samples in ambient storage, or 716 days for samples stored at refrigerated temperature. Metronidazole benzoate in SyrSpend SF, which was packaged in amber plastic prescription bottles, is stable for at least 1 year when stored protected from light at ambient condition (25 deg C/60% relative humidity). The shelf life for this product may be extended to 2 years when stored at refrigerated temperature.<p>

Wear studies were performed on polystyrene (PS)-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) mixed polymer brushes and corresponding monobrushes in a dried state. The aim was to study the wear mechanism in polymer brush surfaces as well as to investigate the effect of switching of PS + PAA binary brush surfaces (on treatment with the selective solvents for the PS and PAA) on the wear process. Wear experiments were carried out using atomic force microscopy (AFM) under a controlled environment. The wear experiments were performed as a function of scan number using a sharp silicon nitride tip to induce the wear on the sample surfaces. The wear mechanism on different brush surfaces was influenced by molecular entanglement as well as adhesion and friction on the sample surface. The wear process on the PS monobrush surface treated with toluene took place via formation of the ripples. On the other hand, a typical wear mode observed on the PAA monobrushes was removal of the polymeric material from the surface. For the mixed brush surface treated with toluene (selective solvent for PS) where PS chains dominated the top of the sample surface, the typical wear mode observed was ripple formation similar to that observed for the PS monobrushes. However, when a mixed brush was treated with ethanol and pH 10 water so that PAA chains dominated the top layer, wear occurred via removal of material. The amount of wear on the surfaces increased with the number of scans. Furthermore, the load and scan velocity dependence of the wear process was also investigated. Wear on polymer brush surfaces increased on increasing the load and/or decreasing the scan speed. The present study shows that wear can be controlled/tuned using mixed responsive brushes.<p>

This is a case report and family study of a 65-year-old man with chronic prurigo lesions, in whom we demonstrated a selective deficiency of circulating T-helper/inducer lymphocytes (CD4+), in the absence of any apparent predisposing disease. He is seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV types 1 and 2) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I and HTLV-II), and fulfils the criteria for the syndrome of idiopathic CD4+ T lymphocytopenia. He has an atopic diathesis, has had a severe adult chickenpox infection, chronic staphylococcal infections, tinea pedis and recalcitrant warts. He has also suffered from respiratory infections, for which no specific aetiological agent has been identified. His peripheral total lymphocyte count has been persistently abnormal since it was first measured in 1969. He has a marked CD4+ T-cell lymphocytopenia.

Embryos of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus develop in egg sacs carried on the abdomen of the female. They develop over a period of 10-13 days at 28 degrees C and are nutritionally dependent on yolk until they emerge from the egg sacs as free-swimming zoeae. The principal component of blue crab yolk is lipovitellin (LpII), a water-soluble lipoprotein composed of approximately equal amounts of lipid and protein. We followed changes in the concentration of apoproteins of LpII during embryogenesis by ELISA and Western blots, using monoclonal antibodies against two LpII apoprotein associated peptides identified as Protein A (107 kDa) and Protein B (75 kDa). During embryogenesis there was a decrease in Protein B but an increase in two smaller peptides (52 and 35 kDa) that reacted with the Protein B antibody. Utilization of LpII during embryogenesis was also followed morphologically by immunohistochemistry. Utilization of LpII was slow in early embryonic stages, followed by rapid utilization in late embryonic stages, such that only traces of LpII were present at the end of embryogenesis. The cells of the developing hepatopancreas appear to play an important role in the utilization of LpII.<p>

Active management and controlling of one's social setting is an essential basis for physical and psychological well-being. A concept which aims at building abilities for an individual responsible and autonomous life is empowerment. Due to the demographic development, this concept will become more important for the elderly. In our productive and work-life related society, this age group is often considered as a burden. Their age group-specific potential is not sufficiently recognised and utilised, e.g., regarding its possible supportive role in interactions between a community's generations. This article illustrates different levels and strategies of empowerment for the elderly and analyses some concepts. One of these concepts is health literacy, which is defined as gaining competence, e.g., for the understanding of information or for acting on health-related issues. Studies of association between health literacy and health outcomes in the elderly are represented. Additionally, the promotion of empowerment is part of the prevention and health care, e.g., in terms of &quot;active management&quot; and &quot;passive management&quot;. A further focus is improving the empowerment in elderly employees.<p>

Several research groups around the world have studied diverse aspects of energy metabolism in arthropod disease vectors, with the aim of discovering potential control targets. As in all oviparous organisms, arthropod embryonic development is characterized by the mobilization of maternally-derived metabolites for the formation of new tissues and organs. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine-threonine kinase described as an important regulator of metabolism and development in a wide range of organisms. GSK-3 was first identified based on its action upon glycogen synthase, a central enzyme in glycogen biosynthesis. Currently, it is recognized as a key component of multiple cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, apoptosis, cell proliferation, transcription, cell migration, and immune response. The present review will describe the current knowledge on GSK-3 activation and its role in morphogenesis and embryonic metabolism in arthropods. Altogether, the information discussed here can spark new approaches and strategies for further studies, enhancing our understanding of these important arthropod vectors and strengthening the resources in the search for novel control methods.<p>

Among organelles, lipid droplets (LDs) uniquely constitute a hydrophobic phase in the aqueous environment of the cytosol. Their hydrophobic core of neutral lipids stores metabolic energy and membrane components, making LDs hubs for lipid metabolism. In addition, LDs are implicated in a number of other cellular functions, ranging from protein storage and degradation to viral replication. These processes are functionally linked to many physiological and pathological conditions, including obesity and related metabolic diseases. Despite their important functions and nearly ubiquitous presence in cells, many aspects of LD biology are unknown. In the past few years, the pace of LD investigation has increased, providing new insights. Here, we review the current knowledge of LD cell biology and its translation to physiology.<p>

Arginine kinase (AK), a primary enzyme in cell metabolism and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-consuming processes, plays an important role in cellular energy metabolism and maintaining constant ATP levels in invertebrate cells. In order to identify genes that are differentially expressed between larvae and adults, queens and workers, and female alates (winged) and queens (wingless), AK cDNA was obtained from the red imported fire ant. The cDNA sequence of the gene has open reading frames of 1065 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 355 amino acid residues that includes the substrate recognition region, the signature sequence pattern of ATP:guanidino kinases, and an &quot;actinin-type&quot; actin binding domain. Northern blot analysis and protein activity analysis demonstrated that the expression of the AK gene and its protein activity were developmentally, caste specifically, and tissue specifically regulated in red imported fire ants with a descending order of worker&gt; alate (winged adult) female&gt; alate (winged adult) male&gt; larvae&gt; worker pupae approximately alate pupae. These results suggest a different demand for energy-consumption and production in the different castes of the red imported fire ant, which may be linked to their different missions and physiological activities in the colonies. The highest level of the AK gene expression and activity was identified in head tissue of both female alates and workers and thorax tissue of workers, followed by thorax tissue of female alates and abdomen tissue of male alates, suggesting the main tissues or cells in these body parts, such as brain, neurons and muscles, which have been identified as the major tissues and/or cells that display high and variable rates of energy turnover in other organisms, play a key role in energy production and its utilization in the fire ant. In contrast, in the male alate, the highest AK expression and activity were found in the abdomen, suggesting that here energy demand may relate to sperm formation and reproduction.<p>

The encoding AK gene from Shrimp Metapenaeus ensis (M. ensis) was cloned in prokaryotic expression plasmid pET-28a, and it was then expressed in Escherichia coil in dissoluble form. The recombinant protein was purified by following three chromatography steps in turn: CM-Cellulose cation-exchange, Sephacryl S-100HR gel filtrate and DEAE-Sepharose anion-exchange. The purified AK's apparent K(m) was 2.33+/-0.1 and 1.59+/-0.2 mM for ATP and l-arginine, respectively, while its optimum pH and temperature was 8.5 and 30 degrees C in the process of forward reaction, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of cDNA-derived amino acid sequences for the AKs indicated a close affinity of M. ensis and another shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).<p>

Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) is an intracellular membrane bound enzyme that utilizes the free energy of ATP to transport Ca(2+) against a concentration gradient. In the present study, a new SERCA gene (LvSERCA) from white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) was cloned using suppression subtractive hybridization and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The full-length cDNA of LvSERCA contained an open reading frame of 3,009 bp coding for 1,002 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of approximately 109.8 kDa. The identity analysis of the amino acid sequence of LvSERCA showed that it is highly conserved with 10 transmembrane alpha-helices, one P-domain, one A-domain and one N-domain. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that LvSERCA is similar to other Arthropoda SERCA proteins. The mRNA levels of LvSERCA under salinity stress (3 and 40 g L(-1)) were analyzed by reverse transcription PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that LvSERCA was expressed in all tissues detected. LvSERCA mRNA levels were significantly higher under hyper-salinity than hypo-salinity. These results highlight that Ga(2+)-ATPase plays an essential role in adjustment salinity stress, which may be useful for selective breeding of L. vannamei.<p>

The primary objective of this study was to compare the magnitude of injury in mouse extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscles induced by high-force eccentric contractions. A second objective was to study the effect of altering the daily loading of the muscles through hindlimb suspension (HS) on the injury. One of two protocols was performed in vitro: 1) 15 eccentric contractions (n = 20: 10 EDL and 10 soleus muscles) or 2) 15 isometric contractions (n = 20: 10 EDL and 10 soleus muscles). After the protocol, the decrements in contractile performance and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were measured at 15-min intervals over 1 h. Immediately after the eccentric contraction protocol, markedly greater decrements in maximal isometric tetanic force (Po) occurred in the normal EDL than in the normal soleus muscles (60.7 +/- 4.2 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.1%, P &lt; or = 0.0001). LDH release immediately after the eccentric contraction protocol was 2.7-fold greater in the normal EDL than in the normal soleus muscles. To investigate the role of recent loading of the muscles in the injury, EDL (n = 9) and soleus (n = 10) muscles from mice subjected to HS for 14 days performed the eccentric contraction protocol. HS resulted in greater decrements in contractile performance for the soleus muscles (decreases in Po immediately after the protocol for HS and normal soleus muscles were 31.0 +/- 1.8 and 7.6 +/- 2.1%, respectively; P &lt; or = 0.0001) but not for the EDL muscles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

BACKGROUND: Cardiac involvement in Churg-Strauss vasculitis worsens the prognosis. Early detection is, therefore, warranted. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can visualize various forms of inflammatory changes in the myocardium. We tested whether CMR could elucidate cardiac damage in patients with biopsy-proven Churg-Strauss syndrome and clinical evidence of cardiac involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent a CMR protocol including cine imaging for left ventricular function in long axes, T2-weighted imaging for edema detection, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighting for early and late gadolinium enhancement. CMR detected various form of myocardial injury in all patients. Systolic left ventricular function was impaired in 6 patients. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 45 +/- 15%. Left ventricular size was mildly enlarged (left ventricular end-diastolic volume index 94 +/- 23 mL/m(2)). Edema was present in 4 cases; 7 patients had pericardial effusion. Six patients had increased early contrast uptake. CMR detected late enhancement lesions in 9 of 11 patients, even in those with normal left ventricular size and function. CONCLUSIONS: CMR has the potential to detect myocardial injury in Churg-Strauss syndrome even when left ventricular function appears normal.<p>

Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) are key regulators of neuronal excitability and important factors in epileptogenesis and neurodegeneration. Recent findings suggest a novel, important proictogenic and proneuroapoptotic role of the Ca(v)2.3 E/R-type VGCCs in convulsive generalized tonic-clonic and hippocampal seizures. Though Ca(v)2.3 is also expressed in key structures of the thalamocortical circuitry, their functional relevance in non-convulsive absence seizure activity remains unknown. To this end, we investigated absence specific spike-wave discharge (SWD) susceptibility in control and Ca(v)2.3-deficient mice by systemic administration of gamma-hydroxybutyrolactone (GBL, 70 mg/kg i.p.), followed by electrocorticographic radiotelemetric recordings, behavioral analysis and histomorphological characterization. Based on motoric studies, SWD and power-spectrum density (PSD) analysis, our results demonstrate that Ca(v)2.3(-/-) mice exhibit increased absence seizure susceptibility and altered absence seizure architecture compared to control animals. This study provides evidence for the first time that Ca(v)2.3 E/R-type Ca2+ channels are important in modulating thalamocortical hyperoscillation exerting anti-epileptogenic effects in non-convulsive absence seizures.<p>

Compared to humans, chimpanzees appear to be less susceptible to many types of cancer. Because DNA repair defects lead to accumulation of gene and chromosomal mutations, species differences in DNA repair are one plausible explanation. Here we analyzed the repair kinetics of human and chimpanzee cells after cisplatin treatment and irradiation. Dot blots for the quantification of single-stranded (ss) DNA repair intermediates revealed a biphasic response of human and chimpanzee lymphoblasts to cisplatin-induced damage. The early phase of DNA repair was identical in both species with a peak of ssDNA intermediates at 1 h after DNA damage induction. However, the late phase differed between species. Human cells showed a second peak of ssDNA intermediates at 6 h, chimpanzee cells at 5 h. One of four analyzed DNA repair-associated genes, UBE2A, was differentially expressed in human and chimpanzee cells at 5 h after cisplatin treatment. Immunofluorescent staining of gammaH2AX foci demonstrated equally high numbers of DNA strand breaks in human and chimpanzee cells at 30 min after irradiation and equally low numbers at 2 h. However, at 1 h chimpanzee cells had significantly less DNA breaks than human cells. Comparative sequence analyses of approximately 100 DNA repair-associated genes in human and chimpanzee revealed 13% and 32% genes, respectively, with evidence for an accelerated evolution in promoter regions and introns. This is strikingly contrasting to the 3% of DNA repair-associated genes with positive selection in the coding sequence. Compared to the rhesus macaque as an outgroup, chimpanzees have a higher accelerated evolution in non-coding sequences than humans. The TRF1-interacting, ankyrin-related ADP-ribose polymerase (TNKS) gene showed an accelerated intraspecific evolution among humans. Our results are consistent with the view that chimpanzee cells repair different types of DNA damage faster than human cells, whereas the overall repair capacity is similar in both species. Genetic differences in non-coding sequence elements may affect gene regulation in the DNA repair network and thus contribute to species differences in DNA repair and cancer susceptibility.<p>

The continuity of the xylem water columns was studied on 17- to 23-m tall birch trees (trunk diameter about 23 cm; first branching above 10 m) all year round. Fifty-one trees were felled, and 5-cm thick slices or 2-m long boles were taken at regular, relatively short intervals over the entire height of the trees. The filling status of the vessels was determined by (i) xylem sap extraction from trunk and branch pieces (using the gas bubble-based jet-discharge method and centrifugation) and from trunk boles (using gravity discharge); (ii) (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of slice pieces; (iii) infusion experiments (dye, (86)Rb(+), D(2)O) on intact trees and cut branches; and (iv) xylem pressure measurements. This broad array of techniques disclosed no evidence for continuous water-filled columns, as postulated by the Cohesion-Tension theory, for root to apex directed mass transport. Except in early spring (during the xylem refilling phase) and after extremely heavy rainfall during the vegetation period, cohesive/mobile water was found predominantly at intermediate heights of the trunks but not at the base or towards the top of the tree. Similar results were obtained for branches. Furthermore, upper branches generally contained more cohesive/mobile water than lower branches. The results suggest that water lifting occurs by short-distance (capillary, osmotic and/or transpiration-bound) tension gradients as well as by mobilisation of water in the parenchymatic tissues and the heartwood, and by moisture uptake through lenticels.<p>

Westhoff, T. H., et al. (2009). &quot;Chronic norovirus infection in renal transplant recipients.&quot; <u>Nephrol Dial Transplant</u> <b>24</b>(3): 1051-1053.<p>
Norovirus infection is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis. In immunocompetent subjects, norovirus infection is a self-limiting disease of short duration. The present report provides first evidence that norovirus can cause chronic infection in renal transplant recipients. Two patients showed persisting norovirus excretion for &gt;7 months and 3 months, respectively. The first patient was asymptomatic after an acute episode of gastroenteritis and eliminated the virus spontaneously. The second patient developed severe symptomatic chronic infection with diffuse abdominal discomfort, fever, transient transplant dysfunction, recurrent episodes of diarrhoea, weight loss and histological signs of chronic intestinal inflammation. Norovirus elimination and relief of symptoms occurred only after reduction of immunosuppression. Thus, norovirus can evoke asymptomatic and symptomatic chronic infection in renal transplant recipients. Norovirus should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of both acute and chronic diarrhoea after transplantation. Reduction of immunosuppression may be indicated to allow virus elimination in symptomatic cases.<p>

We studied the relations between glutathione-dependent detoxifying enzymes and heavy metal burdens in the web-building spider Agelena labyrinthica (Agelenidae) and the wolf spider Pardosa lugubris (Lycosidae) from five meadow sites along a heavy metal pollution gradient. We assayed the activity of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione peroxidases (GPOX, GSTPx), and glutathione (GSH) levels in both sexes. Except for GSH vs Pb content, we found significant correlations between GPOX and GSTPx activity and metal concentrations in females of A. labyrinthica. The highest activity of these enzymes measured in the web-building spiders was found in the individuals from the most polluted sites. In P. lugubris males significant correlations were found between GST and Pb and Zn concentrations, and between GPOX and GSTPx and the concentration of Cu. GST activity was higher in males collected from less polluted areas. Thus, detoxifying strategies against pollutants seemed to be sex-dependent. Actively hunting spiders had higher metal concentrations, maintaining lower activity of detoxifying enzymes and a lower glutathione level.<p>

In the funnel web spider Agelena labyrinthica (Agelenidae; A. l.), sheet web spider Linyphia triangularis (Linyphiidae; L. t.) and wolf spider Xerolycosa nemoralis (Lycosidae; X. n.) from two differently polluted meadow sites in southern Poland, we studied the relations between antioxidant parameters (glutathione, GSH; glutathione peroxidases, GPOX, GSTPx; catalase, CAT; stress proteins-Hsp70, metallothioneins Mts), the intensity of apoptosis and necrosis, and heavy metal burdens of the midgut gland. Cellular reactions against stress caused by pollutants seemed to be sex-dependent. The concentrations of Zn and Cu in the midgut glands of male A. l. and X. n. were more than double that of the females, from both study sites. In male spiders from the heavily polluted site, both negative correlations (activity of caspase-3-like proteins vs Cu, Zn concentration; number of depolarized mitochondria vs Cu concentration) and positive correlations (number of necrotic cells vs Cu concentrations; activity of CAT vs Zn ) were noted. The defense of males against high metal content and its prooxidative effects is based mainly on GSH and CAT. In females the antioxidative reactions are species-specific and depend mainly on high peroxidase activity and on stress protein level. The increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the midgut gland of female spiders from the heavily polluted site suggests the defensive role of this process in maintaining the proper functioning of this organ.<p>

The similarities and differences in dream content at the cross-cultural, gender, and individual levels provide one starting point for carrying out studies that attempt to discover correspondences between dream content and various types of waking cognition. Hobson and Kahn's (Hobson, J. A., &amp; Kahn, D. (2007). Dream content: Individual and generic aspects. Consciousness and Cognition, 16, 850-858.) conclusion that dream content may be more generic than most researchers realize, and that individual differences are less salient than usually thought, provides the occasion for a review of findings based on the Hall and Van de Castle (Hall, C., &amp; Van de Castle, R. (1966). The content analysis of dreams. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.) coding system for the study of dream content. Then new findings based on a computationally intensive randomization strategy are presented to show the minimum sample sizes needed to detect gender and individual differences in dream content. Generally speaking, sample sizes of 100-125 dream reports are needed because most dream elements appear in less than 50% of dream reports and the magnitude of the differences usually is not large.<p>

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the surgical treatment of choice for symptomatic gallstones. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs offer effective analgesia, avoiding the central side effects of opiate drugs. To assess intramuscular diclofenac sodium (Voltarol; Ciba-Geigy) after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 55 consecutive patients (41 female; 14 male; mean age: 50 years) were randomised to receive either diclofenac or placebo in double-blind fashion. Six patients were withdrawn from study (three conversions to open cholecystectomy; three incomplete documentation). Pain scores were assessed at 4, 24, and 48 h using a linear analogue scale; opiate consumption and time to first oral fluid and food were recorded. In 26 patients receiving diclofenac, median scores at 4 h were 1.6 (range 0-7.6) as compared with 4.1 (range 0-7.6) in 23 control patients (p = 0.05, 95% confidence limits 3.2, 0; Mann-Whitney U test). Nausea scores, return to diet, and time to discharge did not differ significantly between the groups.

The use of any chemical as a pesticide results in the exposure of the environment to the chemical. The extent of this exposure depends on the way the chemical is applied—pattern, rate, and frequency—as well as its persistence in the environment. Humans can control all these parameters save the last. A chemical’s persistence is determined by its physicochemical properties: half-life in soil and water, photolytic stability, and soil-binding ability. These same factors also affect the chemical’s bioavailability to living organisms.<p>

The present study was designed to examine recall and rehearsal in short-term memory among children with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Children with onset of IDDM before age 5 years, children with onset after 5 years, and children without IDDM were administered a measure of short-term memory that provides information about rehearsal as well as level of recall. Children with later onset of diabetes and children without IDDM were expected to recall more words and use more effective rehearsal strategies than children with early onset of diabetes. Results indicate that children diagnosed with IDDM early in life used similar rehearsal strategies but recalled fewer words than children with later onset of diabetes and children without IDDM. In addition, results provide evidence that children who are in poor control of their diabetes did not use strategies designed to increase recall as often, or as well as, children in better control of their diabetes.<p>

Insect eggs must obtain oxygen across the eggshell to support embryonic development. Because eggs are small, obtaining enough oxygen would seem trivial. Recent work, however, has shown that eggs of a moth, Manduca sexta, are oxygen limited at high but realistic temperatures (32-37 degrees C) and that P(O2) drops steeply across the eggshell. Here we use theoretical and experimental approaches to partition the total resistance to oxygen flux among several steps in the oxygen cascade from environment to embryo. Standard mass-transfer analysis suggests that boundary layers of air around eggs, and around substrates to which they are attached, offer negligible resistance. Likewise, a mathematical model, parameterized using published and newly obtained morphological data, predicts that air-filled parts of the chorion also do not resist oxygen flux. This prediction was confirmed by experiments that measured rates of carbon dioxide emission from batches of eggs subjected simultaneously to hypoxia and inert gas substitution: depression of metabolic rate by hypoxia was not rescued when the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in air was doubled by substituting helium for nitrogen. The model did predict, however, that a set of subchoral layers (a crystalline chorionic layer, a wax layer and the vitelline membrane) could account for most or all of the total resistance to oxygen flux. Support for this prediction was obtained from two sequential experiments. First, eggs extracted with chloroform:methanol had highly elevated rates of water loss, suggesting that indeed eggs of M. sexta are waterproofed by wax. Second, rates of water loss and carbon dioxide emission from batches of eggs, measured from laying to hatching, changed in parallel over development. These data suggest that a single layer, likely a wax layer or a combination of wax and other subchoral layers, provides the main resistance to water efflux and oxygen influx.<p>

Most terrestrial insect embryos support metabolism with oxygen from the environment by diffusion across the eggshell. Because metabolism is more temperature sensitive than diffusion, embryos should be relatively oxygen-limited at high temperatures. We tested whether survival, development time and metabolism of eggs of a moth, Manduca sexta, were sensitive to experimentally imposed variation in atmospheric oxygen availability (5-50 kPa; normoxia at sea level is 21 kPa) across a range of biologically realistic temperatures. Temperature-oxygen interactions were apparent in most experiments. Hypoxia affected survival more strongly at warmer temperatures. Metabolic rates, measured as rates of CO2 emission, were virtually insensitive to hypo- and hyperoxia at 22 degrees C but were strongly influenced at 37 degrees C. Radial profiles of P(O2) inside eggs, measured using an oxygen microelectrode, demonstrated that 3-day-old eggs had broad central volumes with P(O2) less than 2 kPa, and that higher temperature led to lower P(O2). These data indicate that at realistically high temperatures (32-37 degrees C) eggs of M. sexta were oxygen limited, even in normoxia. This result has important implications for insect population ecology and the evolution of eggshell structures, and it suggests a novel hypothesis about insect gigantism during Paleozoic hyperoxia.<p>

Porcine granulosa cells have been shown previously to both secrete and respond to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), suggesting an autocrine function of this peptide in the follicle. The present work was undertaken to determine possible effects of IGF-I on in vitro maturation, in vitro fertilization, and early embryonic development in culture. Granulosa and cumulus cell proliferation and differentiation based on 3H-thymidine uptake and progesterone production, respectively, were also assessed. The results showed that the cleavage rate of oocytes was markedly stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of IGF-I to the oocyte maturation medium (P &lt; 0.05). Embryo development beyond the 8-cell stage was improved by IGF-I, reaching a maximum of 22% at 200 ng/ml IGF-I. Treatment with IGF-I after fertilization increased the percentage of total oocyte cleavage (P &lt; 0.05) to approximately 52%, 43%, and 57% at, respectively, 25, 50, and 100 ng/ml IGF-I. 3H-thymidine incorporation by granulosa cells was significantly increased in cultures treated with FSH (3-fold) or IGF-I (6-fold) compared to the control. For the cumulus cells, FSH caused a similar increase (3-fold) in 3H-thymidine incorporation while IGF-I stimulated a 15-fold increase. Progesterone production by the granulosa cells was increased to the same extent by treatment with FSH or IGF-I (4.7 and 5.1-fold, respectively). However, for the cumulus cells, while FSH caused a marked 16-fold increase in progesterone production, IGF-I caused only a marginal increase of 2.5-fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)<p>

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a reliable and reproducible technique for measuring mRNA expression. To facilitate gene expression studies and obtain more accurate qRT-PCR analysis, normalization relative to stable housekeeping genes is mandatory. In this study, ten housekeeping genes, including beta-actin (Actin) , elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A) , glyceralde hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) , ribosomal protein L13 (RPL13) , ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) , alpha-tubulin (Tubulin) , vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (v-ATPase) , succinate dehydrogenase subunit A (SDHA) , 28S ribosomal RNA (28S) , and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S) from the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, were selected as the candidate reference genes. Four algorithms, geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper, and the DeltaCt method, were used to evaluate the performance of these candidates as endogenous controls across different developmental stages. In addition, RefFinder, which integrates the above-mentioned software tools, provided the overall ranking of the stability/suitability of these candidate reference genes. Among them, PRL13 and v-ATPase were the two most stable housekeeping genes across different developmental stages. This work is the first step toward establishing a standardized qRT-PCR analysis in T. urticae following the MIQE guideline. With the recent release of the T. urticae genome, results from this study provide a critical piece for the subsequent genomics and functional genomics research in this emerging model system.<p>

The structural and functional unit of the thyroid gland is the follicle, consisting of a closed lumen surrounded by a single layer of polarized epithelial cells. In this paper we have attempted to characterize the process of lumenal development when primary cultures of porcine thyroid cells reorganized to form follicles. Cells incubated with the loop diuretic, bumetanide, an inhibitor of NaK2Cl cotransport, aggregated but failed to form normal follicles. Laser scanning confocal microscopy combined with immunohistochemical markers of thyroid cell-surface proteins demonstrated that in the presence of bumetanide cells polarized and assembled ZO-1-containing tight junctions separating their apical and basolateral membrane domains. Cultures formed small lumena but their subsequent growth was inhibited by bumetanide. Electrophysiological studies confirmed that bumetanide-sensitive Cl- transport was the major contributor to the transepithelial electrical potential difference across the follicular wall after 48 h incubation. Other potential mechanisms did not contribute significantly to follicular lumenal growth. In particular, bumetanide did not affect cell proliferation and, in contrast to tissue follicles, thyroglobulin could not be detected within the lumena of cultured follicles. We conclude that thyroid follicular reorganization involves two distinct and separate phases of lumenal development: initial lumen formation which probably reflects the assembly of a specialized apical membrane domain; and subsequent lumenal growth which is mediated by the inward transport of Cl- by polarized epithelial cells.<p>

PURPOSE: A proof of principle for cell killing by Gadolinium (Gd) neutron capture in Magnevist preloaded Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells is provided. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U87cells were pre-loaded with 5 mg/ml Magnevist (Gd containing compound) and irradiated using an enhanced neutron beam developed at NIU Institute for Neutron Therapy at Fermilab. These experiments were possible because of an enhanced fast neutron therapy assembly designed to use the fast neutron beam at Fermilab to deliver a neutron beam containing a greater fraction of thermal neutrons and because of the development of improved calculations for dose for the enhanced neutron beam. Clonogenic response was determined. RESULTS: U87 cell survival after gamma irradiation, fast neutron irradiation and irradiation with the enhanced neutron beam in the presence or absence of Magnevist were determined. CONCLUSIONS: U87 cells were the least sensitive to gamma radiation, and increasingly sensitive to fast neutron irradiation, irradiation with the enhanced neutron beam and finally a significant enhancement in cell killing was observed for U87 cells preloaded with Magnevist. The sensitivity of U87 cells pre-loaded with Magnevist and then irradiated with the enhanced neutron beam can at least in part be attributed to the Auger electrons emitted by the neutron capture event.<p>

The authors evaluated the anatomical location of the central sulcus (CS) in 24 cerebral hemispheres (eight in which tumors were located centrally, 16 in controls) using: 1) classic anatomical landmarks seen on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (24 hemispheres); 2) functional MR imaging (24 hemispheres); and 3) intraoperative electrical stimulation mapping (eight hemispheres). On MR imaging the CS was identified with certainty in 79% of hemispheres (four of eight in patients, 15 of 16 in controls). Functional MR imaging identified a parenchymal &quot;motor hand area&quot; in only 83% (20 of 24 hemispheres; five of eight in patients, 15 of 16 in controls); this area was located in the precentral gyrus in 16 (80%) of 20, additionally in the postcentral gyrus in 10 (50%) of 20, and exclusively in the postcentral gyrus in four (20%) of 20. In contrast, functional MR imaging detected one to three sulcal veins presumably draining blood from the adjacent motor hand area in 100% (24 of 24) of the hemispheres studied, and anatomical MR imaging and intraoperative mapping localized these veins in the CS. It is concluded that sulcal veins lying deep within the CS: 1) drain activated blood from the adjacent pre- or postcentral cortex during performance of a motor hand task; 2) can be identified easily with functional MR imaging; and 3) are an anatomical landmark for noninvasive identification of the CS and thus the sensorimotor strip. The detection of these veins provides a more consistent landmark than the detection of parenchymal motor areas by functional MR imaging; this technique may be used when classic anatomical landmarks fail to identify the sensorimotor strip.<p>

Aging is an inevitable biological process that affects most living organisms. Despite the enormous consequences associated with the aging process, until recently, relatively little systematic effort has been expended on the scientific understanding of this important life process. Society, however, urged by an ever increasing older population, is challenging scientists from many disciplines to explore one of nature's most complex phenomena-biological aging. For the past two decades, research directed toward the basic understanding of biological aging mechanisms and possible aging interventions have given us new insights into the molecular bases and the biological events that contribute to age-related deterioration. To further investigate the aging processes, one probe uniquely suited to exploring the progression of aging in animal models is dietary restriction, currently the only antiaging intervention accepted by gerontologists and nutritionists. Recent research renders a better understanding of how reduced dietary intake extends the life span, supplying evidence that dietary restriction is a diverse and effective modulator of oxidative stress. It has been proposed that this antioxidative mechanism is the underlying anti-aging action of dietary restriction.<p>

Triggered hydrogelation of MAX1 peptide, (VK)(4)-V(D)PPT-(KV)(4)-NH(2), proceeds through peptide intramolecular folding into beta-hairpins and concomitant self-assembly into branched clusters of well-defined (uniform, 3 nm cross section), semiflexible, beta-sheet-rich nanofibrils. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy indicates that dangling fibrils extend from one growing cluster to another and lead to early, intercluster communication in solution. At the apparent percolation threshold, the dynamic shear modulus measured by oscillatory rheology (G'(omega), G''(omega) proportional, variant omega(n)) and the field-intensity autocorrelation function measured by dynamic light scattering (g(1)(tau) proportional, variant tau(-beta')) show power-law behavior with comparable critical dynamic exponents (n approximately 0.47 and beta' approximately 0.45). Finite interpenetration of percolating clusters with smaller clusters, along with permanent intercluster entanglements, increase the network rigidity. The self-assembly of MAX1 peptide was compared and contrasted with the assembly of other biopolymeric networks in literature.<p>

A novel isoform of UDP-GalNAc:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, designated ppGaNTase-T3, has been cloned from a mouse testis cDNA library and expressed in COS7 cells. ppGaNTase-T3 displayed 64 and 59% amino acid identity with ppGaNTase-T1 and ppGaNTase-T2, respectively, and 96% amino acid identity with the recently reported human form of ppGaNTase-T3. The ppGaNTase-T3 transcript is abundant in the major salivary glands, gastrointestinal tract and both the male and female reproductive systems. ppGaNTase-T3 and ppGaNTase-T1 display overlapping substrate preferences in vitro, although mapping studies of O-glycosylated peptides suggests that certain hydroxyamino acids are preferentially glycosylated by each isoform. This suggests that more than one isoform of ppGaNTase may be required to complete the O-glycosylation of endogenous substrates.<p>

The lipid droplet (LD) is an organelle with vital functions found in nearly all organisms. LD proteomic research has provided fundamentally important insights into this organelle's functions. The review provides a summary of LD proteomic studies conducted across diverse organisms and cell and tissue types. The accumulated proteomic data are reviewed for evidence of a protein targeting mechanism for the organelle. The hypotheses for several specific localization mechanisms based on what is known about targeting mechanisms for other organelles and vesicles are provided. Although the nature of the mechanism is not known, the functional data demonstrate that the targeting mechanism and, indeed, the organelle itself, is conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.

Patients with muscular dystrophy have abnormal cardiac function and decreased high-energy phosphate metabolism. Here, we have determined whether the 8 month old mdx mouse, an animal model of muscular dystrophy, also has abnormal cardiac function and energetics. In vivo cardiac MRI revealed 33% and 104% larger right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, respectively, and 17% lower right ventricular ejection fractions in mdx mice compared with controls. Evidence of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction included 18% lower peak filling rates in mdx mouse hearts. Abnormal cardiac function was accompanied by necrosis and lower citrate synthase activity in the mdx mouse heart, suggesting decreased mitochondrial content. Decreased mitochondrial numbers were associated with 38% lower phosphocreatine concentration, 22% lower total creatine, 36% higher cytosolic free ADP concentration and 1.3 kJ/mol lower free-energy available from ATP hydrolysis in whole isolated, perfused mdx mouse hearts than in controls. Transsarcolemmal creatine uptake was 12% lower in mdx mouse hearts. We conclude that the absence of dystrophin in adult mdx mouse heart, as in the heart of human patient, is associated with right ventricular dilatation, left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and abnormal energy metabolism.<p>

Monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA), a derivative of the minimal substructure of lipopolysaccharide (lipid A) possesses immunomodulatory activity of the parent lipid A yet enjoys reduced toxicity. It has previously been reported that pretreatment with MLA reduces myocardial infarct size and stunning in dogs following ischemia and reperfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA) to preserve global cardiac function and peripheral hemodynamics in a rabbit model of prolonged regional ischemia (90 min), and reperfusion (6 h). An evaluation of potential mechanisms by which MLA may preserve cardiac function was also undertaken. Single dose pretreatment with MLA (35 micrograms/kg i.v.) 24 h prior to ischemia resulted in significant improvement in left ventricular developed pressure, dP/dt, rate-pressure product and mean arterial pressure during reperfusion (P &lt; 0.05 v control). Although in this model of prolonged ischemia MLA pretreatment did not reduce infarct size (54.5 +/- 11.4% in control v 63.3 +/- 8.3% in MLA, P = N.S.), evaluation of myocardial adenylate and adenosine catabolite pools at the end of ischemia indicated a preservation of ATP and ADP and a decreased production of downstream adenosine catabolites including inosine, xanthine and uric acid. Adenosine kinase, but not 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NTase) or adenosine deaminase activity determined following reperfusion was 76% and 60% higher (P &lt; 0.05) in non-risk and post-ischemic myocardium of MLA pretreated rabbits compared with controls. Although there was a trend toward lower tissue myeloperoxidase activity in post-ischemic myocardium from treated rabbits, the results were not significantly different from control animals. These results suggest that a 24-h pretreatment with MLA, without further treatment during ischemia or reperfusion was associated with: (1) preservation of global myocardial function during reperfusion; (2) preservation of myocardial high energy adenylates and reduced formation of adenosine catabolites during ischemia; (3) elevated myocardial adenosine kinase activity. Increased recycling of adenosine to phosphorylated nucleotides may result from MLA's affect on adenosine kinase, which could explain the drugs effect on adenylate and adenosine metabolite pools.<p>

Hemocyanins present in invertebrate hemolymph are multifunctional proteins, responsible for oxygen transport and contributing to innate immunity through phenoloxidase-like activity. In arthropods, hemocyanin has been identified as a source of broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides during infection. Conversely, no hemocyanin-derived antimicrobial peptides have been reported for molluscs. The present study describes a putative antimicrobial region, termed haliotisin, located within the linking sequence between the alpha-helical domain and beta-sheet domain of abalone (Haliotis tuberculata) hemocyanin functional unit E. A series of synthetic peptides based on overlapping fragments of the haliotisin region were tested for their bactericidal potential. Incubating Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria in the presence of certain haliotisin peptides, notably peptides 3-4-5 (DTFDYKKFGYRYDSLELEGRSISRIDELIQQRQEKDRTFAGFLLKGFGTSAS) led to reductions in microbial growth. Furthermore, transmission electron micrographs of haliotisin-treated bacteria revealed damages to the microbial cell wall. Data discussed here provides the first evidence to suggest that molluscan hemocyanin may act as a source of anti-infective peptides.<p>

Approximately 30-40% of the dry weight of an insect egg consists of lipid, mostly triacylglycerol (TAG). Although this lipid is essential for the energy needed by the developing embryo, little is known about the mechanism that leads to the accumulation of TAG in the insect egg. Insect oocytes can readily synthesize TAG from free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol, however, de novo synthesis of FAs by the oocyte is marginal. Hence, FAs have to be imported from the fat body or the diet. Insect hemolymph contains two lipoproteins that transport lipids, lipophorin and vitellogenin. Both are taken up via endocytosis by the oocyte, however, this provides only about 10% of the egg's lipid reserves. The rest is unloaded from circulating lipoprotein particles at the oocyte surface in the form of diacylglycerol (DAG), the major lipid transport form in insects, or as FFA. The mechanism of lipoprotein unloading at the oocyte surface is currently unclear. Possible roles of the lipid transfer particle (LTP), FA transporters, and lipoprotein lipase activity are discussed.<p>

INTRODUCTION: Smoking represents the greatest avoidable risk for a large number of serious diseases. The goal of the present study was to investigate the connection between tobacco consumption and back pain, as such a link has yet to be clearly established. METHODS: The analysis was based on the public use file of the German Telephone Health Survey 2003 (n = 8318), carried out by the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin. After exclusion of invalid cases, data on 7271 persons (total model) and 1998 persons (smoker model) were analyzed. RESULTS: Multivariate data analysis clearly shows that not only daily smokers (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.85) but also former smokers (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.07) have a significantly higher chance of suffering from chronic back pain than non-smokers. Number of smoking years is the factor most significantly correlated with chronic back pain, while starting age and amount of tobacco consumed have no impact. DISCUSSION: Owing to the cross-sectional design of this investigation it is not possible to conclude that smoking causes increased back pain through physical dysfunction. Nevertheless, the correlation should be analyzed in a longitudinal study because clarification of causality always represents potential for prevention.<p>

Unlike classical digestive lipases, the scorpion digestive lipase (SDL) has a strong basic character. The SDL activity's optimal pH, when using tributyrin or olive oil as substrate, was 9.0. Added to that, the estimated isoelectric point of the native SDL using the electrofocusing technique, was found to be higher than 9.6. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an animal digestive lipase having such a basic character. When olive oil was used as substrate, SDL was shown to be insensitive to the presence of amphiphilic proteins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). Furthermore, the hydrolysis was found to be specifically dependent on the presence of Ca(2+) ions, since no significant SDL activity was detected in the presence of ions chelator such as EDTA. Nevertheless, the SDL does not require Ca(2+) to trigger the hydrolysis of tributyrin emulsion. Interestingly Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) ions act as strong inhibitors of SDL activity when using tributyrin as substrate. An internal chymotryptic cleavage of SDL generated two fragments of 28 and 25 kDa having the same N-terminal sequence. This sequence of 19 residues does not share any homology with known animal and microbial lipases. Polyclonal antibodies directed against SDL (pAbs anti-SDL) failed to recognise ostrich pancreatic and dog gastric lipases (OPL and rDGL). Moreover, both pAbs anti-OPL and anti-rDGL failed to immunoreact with SDL. These immunological as well as distinct biochemical properties strengthen the idea that SDL appears to belong to a new invertebrate's lipase group.<p>
